            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>Moonlight glimmered through the trees and fell over her black hairs as they wavered in the breeze. Shiv was sitting on a stone far away from where the others were standing. Hans was moving to and fro through the trees, an impatient gesture on his part. He was looking at his watch every minute. Agastya, Aradhya and James were talking slowly. There senses alert for any small noise in the rustling of leaves and brushing of the wind on tree barks. James' eyes constantly flickered in her direction. A big frown creased his forehead. Aradhya was wondering ,"She hasn't uttered a word since then. What could be the matter?". Agastya was thinking,"This is a very dark business."</p><p>"Professor's life is in danger. I'll have to help him. He has always been a father to me, a teacher, but this is solely my decision. I can't put my friends in danger, no, I can't expect them to..", Shiv was stuggling in her mind. "Yes, I'll ask them to leave. Aradhya is my best friend if something happens to her, noooo....". She put her head in her hands. Aradhya came and sat beside her and smiled. Shiv raised her head to look and gave a faint smile in response.</p><p>Five minutes later they heard footsteps. Everyone stood up, they strained their eyes to see amidst the trees. Instinctively Shiv shot her head in the direction of sound and made out the outline of three people walking towards them.&nbsp;</p><p>In a few swift strides they came out in the small clearing where the others stood. Professor Sawhney was standing in front while the others were behind him. In an out of situation expression, Professor was looking quite composed and he even smiled at them. He said," I've to show you all something. Follow me!" Saying this he turned and started walking towards the east, much deeper in the forest.&nbsp;</p><p>Shiv looked at Aradhya who shrugged her shoulders and said," I don't know. We'll see." She started walking. Agastya and Hans were already keeping pace with the others. Shiv started moving towards them when James caught up with her. "Did you see those men! How oddly they are dressed." he said assessing her expression. "No. I was not paying any attention to them. Professor looks quite at ease though.". "Hmm, but look at them!", he said pointing towards those men with his chin and added,"Who wears cloaks these days. Quite Merlin sort of thing. As if any moment they would jump around and curse us all with their magic wands." Shiv, who was looking at those men, smiled widely. James' forhead smoothed out.</p><p>They walked silently. Shiv was looking at those men intently. "They are walking strangely as if they are gliding in the air." she thought ,"and they are quite tall too. Cloaks... huh strange!" At that moment one of the men looked behind. His face was in the shadow. "This man gives me creeps!", murmured Aradhya glancing behind.</p><p>After few minutes Professor's voice sounded," We've reached!"</p><p>Shiv lifted her head to look. A cold breeze went across her face and she shivered.</p><p>They were standing in front of the cave mountain. Professor gestured with his hands to come inside. "But Professor, why, what's here?", said Agastya. "Just come over and see for yourself!", he shouted from inside the cave.</p><p>They moved inside. There, in front of the back wall, those cloaked men were standing. One of them lifted his hand and put the tip of his index finger at the wall. Shiv gasped, she recognised the spot. It was the rectangular patch on the stone which she had found. That man pressed his finger. Suddenly a symbol illuminated with white light and the wall disappeared. A dark room came into existence.</p><p>Professor chuckled at their gaping mouths and stepped inside. As he set his foot on the ground, the room lightened. "What the hell!" exhaled Agastya. &nbsp;</p><p>A bright room materialised in front of them. White metal panelled walls, with no furniture, just a door, in front of them. The two men remained behind and Professor went ahead. As he reached closer, the door opened automatically. They all entered into a big hall. It was carved out of stone and was dimly lit. The door behind them closed and they were all plunged into semi darkness.</p><p>A tall figure was standing in front of them. He turned and looked them full in eyes. The hood of his cloak was down and they could see his ash white face with dark piercing blue eyes. He had a long bony face and black hairs. He slowly neared them. Again Shiv noticed that rather than walking he seemed to be gliding in air.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"These are the comrades of Zahvier" said the man in a dry voice, looking at Aradhya who was in front. His lips twisted in a sneer when he whispered "Humans!" under his breath. "Cecile!", he started in a little higher tone. Shiv turned to look at Professor, who was smilling hugely. He turned his eyes to look at her and in a blink his face changed into another person. Now an ashen white man with dark blue eyes, black hair and sturdy built was facing them in Professor's clothes. He was shorter than the others like him. Shiv uttered a cry which was rather subdued in other's more vocal remarks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Keeping his gaze fixed at her face, Cecile said ,"Yes master!". His lips was twisted in a smirk. "Master, Zahvier was going to meet them today. I lured them here, he will follow."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Sometimes you surprise me Cecile. I thought you just have good looks and no brain." This troubled Cecile a bit because his smile faded and he turned to face his master with pleading eyes. The other man continued without paying any attention to Cecile's reaction," When he comes, bring him to me and kill the spares." Saying this he turned towards the far corner of the hall and stood at a raised platform. He gave them a final look and the next second he vanished into thin air.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Shiv blinked her eyes. What was happening? Was it a dream? She turned to look at James who was staring at the wall, incomprehension was the only feature on his face. Aradhya staggered a few steps to look at Agastya who was utterly shocked. Hans was terrified. His eyes locked at Cecile's leering face.</span></p><p>Cecile turned to the two men who were standing at the back of the hall near the door. There hoods were down and they also had black hair, blue eyes and white skin. They both were burly and heavy. "Go, keep watch", shouted Cecile. They both complied.</p><p>Suddenly a loud noise, accompanied by an explosion blasted the door away. Smoke filled the hall. Shiv tried to look in the smoke, her heart racing. "Zahvier!" groaned Cecile.&nbsp;</p><p>Someone ran out of smoke and shouted ,"DOWN!".</p><p>"Professor", Shiv gasped.</p><p>Professor looked at her for the briefest second, concern gleaming in his black eyes. He said, "Leil, you get them, I'll see Cecile."</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The other girl who had entered with professor, Leilani, singlehandedly charged on the two men. She was nimble and swift, it gave those heavy men a hard time, they struggled to keep up with her as she kicked them down. A final shoot of laser from a device on her hand she finished them off.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Professor and Cecile ran towards each other shooting lasers and ducking at the same moment. "You won't get me this time!", spat Cecile. "We'll see!" said Professor. They charged at each other with almost animal ferocity.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Shiv pulled Aradhya towards the corner where James and Agastya were busy ducking the lasers that came in their direction. "What a day! Shooting lasers, the only thing left to see after people changing faces and invisible doors. I must be dreaming it all", said Agastya making a face. "What's happening?", was the only thing Aradhya managed to say. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"AAAh!", cried Shiv as a laser struck her at arm. "Watch this!" said James and pulled Agastya out of the way of another stray laser beam. "Are you all right?", he managed to speak out to Shiv before ducking again in time. "Did anyone see Hans?", said Aradhya.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Professor shooted at Cecile who ran towards the raised platform. He jumped at it and waved his fingers as he vanished into air.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Shiv slowly went towards the limp body of Hans which was lying on the floor. She kneeled beside him. Aradhya patted on her shoulder, wiping her eyes.</p><p>"What's happening Professor?", asked James as he neared them. "I'll explain later", he panted, "Leil, take them out. Cecile will return soon with help". Leilani gave a nod and gestured to follow.&nbsp;</p><p>James nuged Agastya who was gaping at Leilani's retreating figure.</p><p>Professor came and kneeled beside Hans' body facing Shiv and said ,"He was my best friend", his voice faltered at the last syllable, he took Hans' hand and a tear trickled down his cheek.</p><p>Then clearing his throat he said ,"Hurry, move out. We don't have time!". He stood up and went away. Agastya followed him out. Aradhya stood up and said ,"Come Shiv, we gotta go." Then she walked out.</p><p>Shiv stood up and turned to go. She had moved a few steps when she suddenly returend to Hans' body. She started shuffling in his pockets.</p><p>"What's it?" asked James. "This pen!", she replied as she took it out from his trouser pocket.</p><p>She and James came out in the sunlight. Her eyes tried to adjust in the blinding morning light. &nbsp;</p></div>
