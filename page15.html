            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8">The misty evening crawled in as their car screeched to halt at the Savoy Hotel. It was an old building dating to pre independence times and was refurbished into a luxurious hotel. It was the biggest construction in that small town, just a small distance away from the train station.
<div>Chaitra came out of the car, she stood holding the door with one hand, her face lit of the light that came out of the hotel. Daaruk came up to her ,"Nice buiding, Victorian gothic architecture" he remarked.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Hmm, at the height of 2,500m above sea level", she replied and breathed out mist from her mouth ,"We're all set for some mystery".
</div><div><br></div><div>Chaitra's gaze moved over the building as Daaruk got busy instructing the valet about handling luggage. Mrs. Daksha has already moved in. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Chaitra was staring at the windows when she saw Ahan. He was standing at the other side of the car, facing street, and was gesturing with his fingers, as if summoning someone. Instinctively she looked around but found no one. She hastily reset herself as Ahan was about to turn. She didn't wanted to be noticed spying on someone.
</div><div><br></div><div>They all went inside.
</div><div><br></div><div>There was a small garden inside the hotel surrounded by corridors on all sides. People were coming out of their rooms to enjoy the open air. Fireflies were swerving around the garden flowers producing an effaicaciously beautiful and ornamental view of the surrounding. Fresh hill breeze scented the atmosphere. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Reception was set up in that garden. A fair and fox like lady was sitting there. She raised her eyes to look at the approaching lot and nuged her spectacles with her finger. "Welcome to Savoy Hotel. Are you here for long stay? We have about 150 rooms here, all grand, peaceful, heritageous and we have varieties in them based on the history associated with them. No two rooms alike. What would you like?", she finished in one breath in a squeaking voice.
</div><div><br></div><div>Both Chaitra and Daaruk plumed for mountain view rooms. Mrs. Mani accompanied Chaitra to her room. Ahan escorted Daaruk to his place after the formalities were taken care of.</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Chaitra's mouth hang open at the sight of that large, lavish room. She went up to the heavily curtained windows and looked out at the mountains. She flung open the windows and cool breeze filed in, she shivered. Mrs. Mani questioned the valet regarding the details of the stay. After that she turned to withdraw when Chaitra bombarded her with questions.</span></div><div><br></div><div>"Ma'am do you know anything about this recent dug up?"
</div><div><br></div><div>"How long Ahan had been appointed here?"
</div><div><br></div><div>"What do you think of him? It's strange that so much security is being provided for this bussiness."
</div><div><br></div><div>Mrs. Mani smiled and said in a calm voice ,"My dear! Breathe a moment. I know you must be curious. Even in my twenty years career, never I saw government so much intrested in our work. By the way mysteries are an inseparable part of this place and this hotel."
</div><div><br></div><div>"What do you mean?", asked Chaitra.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Villagefolk here believe in a lot of things. One wouldn't believe them but what you'll do of tourists. Not that I've seen anything in my twenty years here", she said half-heartedly.
</div><div><br></div><div>"I don't understand", said Chaitra, her forehead creased.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Apparitions," said Mrs. Mani ,"Ghosts I mean". Chaitra shook her head. Mrs. Mani clarified ,"I don't say I believe in them but this is what people say. There's a story that years ago there was a lady named Garnel Orme, who was a well known British spiritualist, was murdered in this hotel. Investigations were conducted but they remained empty handed. Except that lady's body they found no clues, no evidences, nothing. And then a few years later her doctor was murdered too in the same suspicious circumstances. I don't know but since I'm here I feel like it's walls hold some serious secrets.
</div><div><br></div><div>"But as I told you I've never had any experience myself so who knows what's the truth. By the way, this place is nice and well kept considering it to be an old building". she finished.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Murder", murmured Chaitra then proceeded loudly ,"This place is really wierd. I mean it's not been even five minutes here and I get to know that two people got murdered here." she turned to look outside the windows and then said ,"Whatever it may be but one thing is certain, there is definitely something hidden beneath this soil that had attracted so many noses".
</div><div><br></div><div>"Yes dear so it seems. By the way, Ahan came here early this morning and after meeting me he directly went to the dig up site."
</div><div><br></div><div>Meanwhile in a corridor Ahan and Daaruk were in midst of a heated debate...
</div><div><br></div><div>"You know how we work, we archeologists adopt the best and finest of methods to find out even an atom of a clue that is coupled with our reasearch", said Daaruk watching Ahan's face intently.
</div><div><br></div><div>Ahan remarked rather sourly ,"That's what all professionals do".
</div><div><br></div><div>"Oh right!", said Daaruk surrendered ,"What do you know about this matter though?", he asked changing the topic.
</div><div><br></div><div>"What's the hurry man, we'll start it tomorrow. Ask the reception if you want anything and Good Night!", Ahan said and went away.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Good night Mr. Didacty", murmured Daaruk under his breath and proceeded in his room.</div></div>
