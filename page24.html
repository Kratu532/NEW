Harsh wind whipped brutally over his clothe wrapped face. Damion put a hand over his eyes and scanned the desolate land. Then went inside his spacecraft.</p><p>A few minutes later he came out, holding a piece of black mirror in his hand. Strange symbols were illuminated on it's surface. He tilted it in several positions moving to and fro untill a little beep sounded from it. Then he again went inside.</p><p>He stuffed some necessaries in his bag and slung it on his back. Then he went to the control board of his craft and clicked a few buttons. "Hide mode on", an automated voice said. Then he came out of his craft and started walking in a particular direction.&nbsp;</p><p>Huge rocks that once boasted of their might were chiseled down by the dust laden wind to strange shapes. Their smooth but rough surface was a specimen of what a persistant wind could do.</p><p>Damion trudged forward, fighting the wind and glancing at his device from time to time. After an hour, he reached the side of a cliff. He rubbed off dust from it's surface and some symbols that were carved on it, came into view. He pressed a symbol with his finger and the cliff wall got depressed a little to show an arched door. He pushed opened the door and went inside.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">He found himself standing inside a huge hall that was carved inside the cliff. A few of the pillars that supported it's ceiling were crumbled into pieces. And it's stone floor was cracked in places. The hall was completely empty except for a beautifully carved stone pedestal that stood in the middle.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Damion went towards that pedestal and touched at few places with his finger. The symbols over it's surface shifted and arranged themselves in a straight line. "Earth", he murmured, his blue eyes shined.</p><p>He took out a glass piece from his bag and put it over those symbols. Then he lifted it up, the image of those symbols had fixed themselves over it.</p><p>He came back to his spacecraft and flew away from Thard.</p></div>
