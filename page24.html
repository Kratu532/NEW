<div>The air was heavy with moisture, big dew drops were settled on the long grass leaves. A gust of cold air rustled the leaves of trees and the water rained down on Shiv's hair. She was strolling aimlessly in the forest enjoying the morning breeze. The horizon was red and sky a tint of blue. A faint shadow of two moons were visible in the sky. The forest was ringing of sounds.
</div><div><br></div><div>After being born in a hot country like India which has eight months of scorching summer, Shambala was a haven for her. She has always been grateful to Shambala for it's dewy mornings, but Norma exceeded her expectations. She took in a deep breath, soaking in the cold moisture, her body shivered in sheer pleasure. A smile spread on her lips.
</div><div><br></div><div>She was not oblivious to the impossibility of the present. Just a few hours ago, if anyone would have told her that Professor was an alien, she must have recommended the person a healthy trip to pshycologist. But now she herself was walking on an alien planet and is surrounded with blooming extraterrestrial life, even for an astrophysicist the idea is outrageous.
</div><div><br></div><div>Now reminded of Professor, her thoughts wandered in a different direction. The difficulty he would have encountered in convincing Mrs. Mufti about his presence there when according to her he should have been under scrutiny. The tragic of all, Hans' death, how on Earth he would have managed that! She instantly felt grief pass on her. Then anxiety, as she thought about Apeirog. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Only once she had seen him, just for a minute, but that was enough time to see what lurked in his blue eyes. She saw his face twisted in pure disgust as he looked down upon them. How easy it was for him to kill others untill he got what he wanted. She wondered will he feel the same if it was one of his family who was in danger. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Her thoughts were interrupted by the sudden appearance of Leilani's grandfather from amidst the woods. "Enjoying the morning, I see", he said in a husky wispering voice. 
</div><div><br></div><div>"Yes. It's quite pleasant here", she beamed.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Can I accompany you?", he asked smiling. 
</div><div><br></div><div>"Oh, sure!", she said a little surprised.
</div><div><br></div><div>Shiv was quite impressed by his peaceful demeanor. In some way he infused the environment with calm, it was quite impossible to be near him and feel distressed. 
</div><div><br></div><div>"Can I ask you something grandpa......?", she hesitated wondering whether he would mind her calling him that.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Yes, my child", he said smiling at her. She again felt as if she was enveloped in peace and calm.
</div><div><br></div><div>"I can't comprehend it all. What professor was doing at Earth?", she began ,"I know it was not for any kind of research. And then Apeirog was at his heels for that pen, why is it so important for him, ("so important that for it he can murder some earthlings", she added in her mind) I mean he is at so high position in Council, why would he bother kidnapping us to get what he want." 
</div><div><br></div><div>"Because what he wants is not his.", he said looking ahead at the trees.
</div><div><br></div><div>"The pen", she said frowning.
</div><div><br></div><div>Grandpa didn't say anything, he just gazed ahead, then as if he had finally decided something he said,"You needn' t worry about that my child, by the way enjoy the days you spend here, everyone doesn't get a chance to visit alien planet". He cordially smiled at her and then went away.
</div><div><br></div><div>She stood there frowing. How easily he refused to answer her. But then she thought that maybe she's being quite nosy.
</div><div><br></div><div>The sun has come up and she retraced her way back to the house as her stomach rumbled for food. As she came out in the clearing she saw James and Aradhya talking in the lawn. She went up to them. 
</div><div><br></div><div>"Where is Agastya?", she asked.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Where do you think he could be?", answered James smiling mischeviously. 
</div><div><br></div><div>"Leilani said that she would have to leave us alone today as she has to report to her team and Professor has now gone to sleep so we have the day to ourselves", said Aradhya ,"What we'll do?"
</div><div><br></div><div>"Some reasearch on alien history. I'll ask Leilani if she could provide us some books." said Shiv. 
</div><div><br></div><div>"You're intrested in history?", asked James frowning.</div><div><br></div><div>"Not history, alien history. Imagine what we'll get to know", she corrected him.
</div><div><br></div><div>"You know, that's a pretty good idea." agreed Aradhya.
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;II</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The house was flooded with luke warm sunshine. Sweet wind glided in from the long windows as they all sat around the wooden table in the sitting room. The table was piled with several rolls of inscriptions. The clothe pages had just yellowed in response to centuries of usage. They looked like ancient vedic scriptures Shiv thought.</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>Leilani had provided them a device to decipher the strange symbols that marched on the pages in horizontal rows. Shiv put the glass piece over the top of the page of the insciption she was holding. The unfathomable symbols changed into the familiar letters that made sense. She read,<em>"The terrible war and slave forces". 
</em></div><div><br></div><div>She slided the glass a little lower on the page and read:
</div><div><em><br></em></div><div><em>The war was in it's most terrible phase. Cosmos ringed with the echos of the cries of bygones. War after war engulfed the soldiers. Chiefs won but soldiers died and soon they realised that they did't have enough armies to fight. The problem always comes with solutions but not always the solutions are sweet.
</em></div><div><br></div><div><em>The chiefs got the most terrible idea, they decided to use spawning civilisations as their puppets. They scanned the cosmos for those beings that were not smart enough and used them as slaves. Those slave did every hardship that their masters told them. Those ruthless masters used them to fight a war that was not theirs.
</em></div><div><br></div><div><em>Some war generals like the fabled Denebola, the most barbarius Zagutian the cosmos has witnessed, was claimed to have been the mistress of the Zosmian army. She got hold of a raw species of beings on whom, as the story goes, she performed the most heinous experiments and made them those emotionless and bloodthirsty soldiers who led her to victory even against the powerful forces of Corvian brothers Zenith and Nadir. 
</em></div><div><br></div><div><em>Those black times witnessed wars for these slave forces. There were wars to get forces for more wars. This vicious cycle of bloodthirst destroyed civilisations after civilisations. Life has never been so cheap as it had been in those times.
</em></div><div><br></div><div><em>After the dawn of the Council the first of the rules that were made to ensure harmony in the cosmos was the Law of Secrecy. It was ensured that the violation of the law brought strict punishment to those who dared to break it. 
</em></div><div><br></div><div>After that the incription delved into more accounts of ruthless generals and their torturous ways they handled the slaves. Shiv stopped reading after sometime. Those accounts have been more horrid than any movie on alien invasion. She felt pleasure that the Council exists and no more wars were going on.
</div><div><br></div><div>She rolled up that inscription and put in on the table and shook her head in hope that the gesture will remove all those images from her mind. 
</div><div><br></div><div>James had been concentrating hard on whatever he was reading because his brows were raised to full extent and his forehead was creased in innumerable lines. Shiv smiled at his comical expression.
</div><div><br></div><div>Instead of reading anything Agastya was busy finding what more that piece of glass could do. Everytime he found something new he showed it to Aradhya who made an impatient grunt and slid a little farther from him on the sofa. 
</div><div><br></div><div>After sometime Shiv again shuffled from the rolls, checking their titles for some safe study, and found one titled <em>"Lores of the Yore".</em> This roll was much more battered than the others. It was torn at the edges and was creased heavily. Shiv unfurled it slowly in order not to degrade it's present state any more. She placed it on the table and slowly slided the glass over it.
</div><div><br></div><div>This inscription was more abstract than any mythological text. It mentioned about civilisations that existed several thousands of years ago and imaginary beings whose survival was not dependent on compounds of nature but deceptive energy sources. Beings who belonged more to the realm of fantasy and imagination than real world. The insciption described them as the inhabitants of the floating worlds and the lava lands. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Shiv shook her head. From her small years of experience as an astronomer she can surely say that nothing like that was possible. But she also thought the same about aliens, didn't she? 
</div><div>After the mention of magical beings the text delved into accounts of impossible weapons. There were all sorts of magical weapons that can vaporise planets in a blink and can stop time. Stones that can give you power to control minds and swords that never failed to harm the intended victim. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Shiv laughed silently. She thought she shoundn't be surprised about it. After all, aliens are not so different from humans, if these stories didn't exist then what will they read out to their children at bedtime. She rolled up the text and put it back into the heap. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Others were still busy reading except Agastya who was toying with the glass piece. Shiv stood up and stretched her arms. Then she went up to the kitchen with the thought of making some tea to freshen up. Now cow's milk was not a thing you would expect to find in a normal Norman kitchen. But the substitute, milk of an animal that quite resembled a cow, was acceptable. </div><div><br></div><div>Yesterday Leilani had urged her to take a sip, though she had always loathed cow's milk except when it was disguised in the form of tea, she was surprised to find that she liked it. It didn't had any exquisite flavour so it can be safely used to make tea. Other ingredients were fortunately present there owing to Professor's personal preferance to the beverage. 
</div><div><br></div><div>She put milk and water to warm up on an induction stove (Normans had that too) and thought she should check whether Professor was up. 
</div><div><br></div><div>She went to his room and slowly opened the door. The room was lighted by the sunlight entering from the open window. She entered inside. The room was bigger than Leilani's. There was a bed in the far corner near the window where Professor was fast asleep wrapped up in the blanket like a cocoon. Opposite to the bed, on the other corner was a table piled with sheets of paper and some books, presumably from Earth. The rest of the room contained little furniture. Just an armchair near the door, a big cupboard on the left wall and some flower pots filled with strange but beautiful fresh flowers. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Shiv turned to go back when she spotted a thing on the table which she thought she recognised. She went up to the table and picked up the box. She remembered having retrived it from Professor's room when she was cleaning it up for Hans' arrival. James and she had tried to open it but didn't succeed. She wondered why Professor would have bought it here at Norma.
</div><div><br></div><div>She strained the tea in four wooden cups and took it to the sitting room. James' head instantly shot up in response to the aroma of tulsi that emanated with steam. He wondered how she gets to know when he wanted a strong cup of tea.
</div><div><br></div><div>As Shiv sat at the sofa with her cup, Aradhya started to pour out whatever she had gained in the last few hours. Shiv was only too well acquainted with her friend's habit and listened animatedly. Agastya grappled James as his audience who was quite impatient to start reading again. Now and then he smiled wryly or said "Oh really!" to please Agastya but his mind wandered again and again to the text he was reading. "It is so fascinating", he thought "can they really do that. If the texts are right then......". His mind was bought back to present by a questioning look at Agastya's face. James smiled and Agastya started again.
</div><div><br></div><div>Suddenly the purr of spacecraft's engine sounded as it softly landed on the grass. Leilani was back!</div></div>
