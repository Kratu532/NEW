In the hurry to tell you about the arrest of professor Sawhney I forgot to tell you about the place, people etc. So here it comes:</p><p><em>Disclaimer: This gonna be boring . Ha! just kiddin". You need to know this to enjoy the story! ;-)</em></p><p>The <strong>Shambala Astronomical Observatory</strong> lies at the side of a cliff in the foot of the mountain range of Himalyas. It's presence at such height is of stratigical importance for the studies conducted there. This observatory consists of a large domed telescope along with a huge hall where all the computer and analytical works are done. There is one small room over the left of the hall, in which professor Sawhney works along with other researchers. There is also a huge room over the right of the hall, where all the documents are kept along with a computer server and other necessary equipments and lab space for reaserch work.</p><p> There is a large garden in front of the observatory with all sorts of flowers and &nbsp;several ivys climbing up to the roof of the hall. A feast for the eyes with a mesmering background of Himalayas, pure as fresh water drop.</p><p>At a distance of few yards there are the quarters for the researchers and workers to live in, as the nearest town was far away.</p><p>As for the town, it lies in the valley down the cliff. Surrounded by the mountain, it sleeps in the lap of nature in such a peace as if it were a newborn baby. The town is not very big, it has a clock tower (which is the highest building in the whole town) and several small houses and settlements.</p><p>As for the people there five in total who work in the observatory. <strong>Professor Sawhney</strong> is the head who lead all the reasearch work &nbsp;carried out there, he is about 60 in age and a very genial person. He is a real genius when it comes to space science. <strong>Agastya</strong> is the computer analyst, he is in his early twenties(22), a true computer geek and a very funny man indeed. <strong>Aradhya</strong> and <strong>Shiv</strong> are the budding reaserchers, both are of about the same age (23-24). <strong>James Watson</strong> is an English reasercher and works here as a temporary recruit from <strong>Starstruck Space Agency</strong> (a big player in space technology at present), he is about 25 in age. He is a true inthusiast in space science. There is also a housekeeper who takes care of this little group, <strong>Mrs. Mufti </strong>, she is a widow and is about 50 in age. Originally an inhabitant of the town down the cliff, now she lives in the house and is in command of the quarters.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Cheers! &nbsp;:-)</span></p></div>
