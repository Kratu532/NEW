            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>Their ship neared the planet, it looked like Earth except that it was more green. As they neared the land, they could make out the huge trees that covered every inch that was available.&nbsp;</p><p>Among the trees there was a large clearing and a timber house was visible in the middle. Leilani slowly lowered the craft which landed in front of the house. The door opened and fresh air gushed in. </p><p>Shiv took a deep breath. It felt like she had never breathed properly. The air was so pure and cool.</p><p>They all came out. Professor remained in ,"I'm going back to Shambala. I'll have to fix some story about your absence and Hans' death," he said with a pained expression ,"I'll be back before father returns". Then he flew away.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Come", said Leilani. They followed her to the two storied timber house.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The house was flooded with light. It was very airy and spacious. A wooden staircase on the right of the sitting room lead to the upper floor which was lined with rooms. On the left of the sitting room was another room. There were several windows around the room that spanned the whole length of the wall.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Not fair! Not even a single human-alien hybrid hanging from the ceiling." joked Agastya. Aradhya rolled her eyes and murmured something under her breath.</span></p><p>"Boys, that room over the left is papa's, go and freshen up. There are some clothes too in the wardrobe." said Leilani indicating a room on the first floor with her finger ,"Ladies follow me!"</p><p>Shiv followed her to a room at the head of the staircase. As they entered, Aradhya went and fell on the bed closing her eyes. Shiv went towards the windows and looked out. At a distance there was a small village, just a handful of houses were visible. Suddenly a bright yellow bird entered in the room through the window. It fearlessly landed over Leilani's head and started chirping. She shook it off and went to her wardrobe. She opened it and said ,"Due to my frequent visits to Earth I have made a good pile of Earthy clothes, you can wear any that you like. I am going to make something to eat. You must be hungry." Shiv's stomach growled in response.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Leilani went out smiling.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Shiv stepped down the stairs, a nice aroma of spices filled the air. "What time is it?", she wondered. "Come in here!", said Leilani peeping out of the room downstairs.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"You have sharp ears. What are you cooking?", said Shiv entering the kitchen. "How about some masala pasta?", Leil answered.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"What do you eat?",asked Shiv. "We are aliens for you but that doesn't mean we eat humans!,"Leil joked ,"Here at Norma we also grow crops and have farms. Though that is not what you expected".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"No.", smiled Shiv.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"As humans have grown out of natural evolution, so we have and that bound to have some similarities. You would have noticed the similarity between Norma and Earth. Our evolution was in much similar ways and that naturally makes us quite alike. All these years papa was with you, did you find anything strange about him?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"You're right!", Shiv agreed. At that moment James entered the kitchen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Perfect fit",exclaimed Leil. "Yeah!",he answered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"When your grandpa will arrive?", he asked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Shouldn't take much time...maybe in half an hour, I suppose......come on, meal's ready", said Leil.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">They helped her carry the plates to the table in the sitting room, which was surrounded with sofas. Aradhya trudged in and sat heavily on the sofa. "I'm totally exhausted. Last night we didn't sleep and then all that happened. Ooof",she complained.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"What time is it?", asked Shiv.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Eighteen in the noon", replied Leil ,"Oh! You mean on Earth....It would be around twelve......Norma has forty eight hours for a day."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Forty eight hours!", exclaimed Agastya who just joined the party. Professor's clothes dangling on his lean figure. Leil smiled widely on him (It gave him a wide shock and he stumbled a few steps).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"May I help you walk?," whispered James in his ears. Agastya gave him a scowl and went to sit beside Shiv. "Don't get angry." she said to him.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Everyone arranged themselves and ate. The conversation didn't began until after cups of strong tulsi tea was handed to everyone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"What's this council? Is it powerful enough to tame this Apeirog?", asked Shiv.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Leil sipped for a moment and then commenced,"Council is the most powerful system in the cosmos. It's like a government to each and every being in the universe, whether they know it exists or not.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"It all started about a million years ago when only nine civilisations existed in the cosmos, Corvi, Norma, Indus, Heka, Procyon, Karka, Olbera, Carpathia and Zagut. They all believed themselves to be the most powerful and advanced, the basis for the stuggle of supremacy that started the most devastating war of all time. All hell broke loose. It was a war that engulfed civilisations. Infant civilisations were the biggest victim, they were not even able to protect themselves.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Then after about thosand years of fierce devastation, Indus came forward for peace. An assembly was called, in which these nine civilisations put an end to the war. They agreed to establish a Council that would be supreme to everyone and they all would abide by it's laws.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Hence the Council dawned. Every civilisation chose it's representative for being a member of the Council. My grandpa succedes a long line of my ancestors who have been Council's member from ages.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"The council is divided into three parts. The highest are the members who make laws for the inhabitants of the cosmos. Then comes the workers who take account of everything that the Council does, from identifying the civilisations to keeping track of criminals...they do it all. Then there are the fighters. Who are like the police on the earth. They protect the innocent and punish the criminals. You know I am a fighter myself", she finished gladly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"You said your ancestors have been Norma's representative from a long time, then won't you be the same." asked Shiv.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"There's no boundation of heirarchy. I am free to choose and papa is there for that." said Leil ,"And after that the people of Norma will choose the successor".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"So this law of secrecy is a mandatory of the Council." said James.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Yes, the strictest. The Council believes that every civilisation should get a chance to grow naturally. Before the war, there had been instances where advanced civilisations made slaves of the infant civilisations and exploited them, some mad creatures even used them for experiments. When Council came into existance, it was decided that untill the baby civilisations became advanced enough to become a part of the Council or to protect themselves from invasions, they should be left undisturbed." Leil said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"But there are some like Apeirog who evade even the Council." said Agastya.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"He thinks that he is kept out of his rights. It so happened that his father, who was a member of the council, became traitor. He cheated on the Council and was later executed. After that Corvi was declined of the right to represent in the Council. That's why Apeirog had to content by being an advisor. But he always tries to persuade the members, he has a very air tight image there, only a few know the truth.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"But the main reason for his power is that he has an army of rogues. He frees those criminals whom we capture by producing fake evidences and then recruits them in his force. Me and my team, we have been trying for so long to gather a clue against him but he is shrewd." Leil made an exasperated face ,"But now I think we finally have him".</span></p><p>At that moment a knock came at the door and an elderly man entered. He had long white hairs and a long beard that came up to his belly. His wrinked face radiated of contempt and satisfaction. His brown wrinkled body was draped in an ochre coloured unstitched cloth. A figure of saint.</p><p>As he stepped inside, his smile faded and his eyes widened a little then in a moment he came back to his calm composure. Leilani exclaimed something in a different language and went up to him. She said ,"This is my grandpa".&nbsp;</p><p>Leilani plunged into a conversation with his grandfather in their language, who was listening to her intently. From time to time his forhead creased and he stopped her to ask something.&nbsp;</p><p>Shiv looked up at the old man when she heard him say "Zahvier", but as she was unable to understand further she left the attempt to listen. She stood up and strolled out of the house.&nbsp;</p><p>The house was surrounded by huge trees. They were larger and sturdier than their Earth counterpart. Shiv take a deep breath and thought ,"We think we are the best untill we encounter something better."&nbsp;</p><p>She went into the forest. The whole surface of the land was covered in green and sunlight glimmered through the canopy. She sat down near a tree, at the spongy soft grass and rested her head at the tree trunk. Strange chirping noises filled the atmosphere. A soft breeze rustled the leaves and she closed her eyes. She had been dozing for sometime when she woke up suddenly at some noise.&nbsp;</p><p>As she opened her eyes she stopped dead. Her heart raced and breath got shallower. Her eyes focused at the creature in front of her. A large black catlike creature stood in front of her. It purred and it's white sharp teeth gleamed. Shiv gulped. Her instincts screamed of danger but she felt like her legs were made of wood. The creature groaned and stealthily stepped forward. Slowly it came so near that she could feel it's breath. The creature's gaze was fixed at her eyes. But then it stopped, it sniffed a few times and then backed away and vanished into the bushes.</p><p>Shiv exhaled and wiped her head. She stood up and walked groggily out of the forest.&nbsp;</p><p>James walked up to her and said ,"Where have you been?". "Nothing, just strolling in the forest." she replied. "What happened?", he asked. "Just saw some alien animals", she said waving the topic away. Though she could still see the creature's dark black eyes gazing at her.</p><p>They entered the house. Agastya and Aradhya was nowhere to be seen. The old man was also not there. James answered her unspoken question ,"Leil's grandpa went away soon after you left. Leil said he needed to fix some issues. She sent Agastya and Aradhya to sleep."</p><p>"You should also go and take some rest", Shiv said. James nodded and went away. "Leil!", she called. Leil answered from the kitchen. She went inside.</p><p>Leil had been busy cleaning. "What he said?" she asked. </p><p>"Grandpa said that it won't be easy to frame Apeirog. And he also thinks that you all have to stay here for sometime. We can't provide you protection out of Norma untill the Council orders so. But don't worry we'll find some way."</p><p>"Hmm," said Shiv and yawned.&nbsp;</p><p>"You should take some sleep", said Leil.</p><p>Shiv entered Leil's room. Aradhya was already deep in sleep. She went to the bed and lied beside her.&nbsp;</p><p>She closed her eyes and saw a pair of black eyes staring at her.</p></div>
