            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>I woke up with a start. A deafening howl pierced the silence of the night and I sat upright in the bed, my heart thumping like a drum. I dared not to imagine the creature whose throat produced the sound. I sat staring in the dark for sometime when again the howl resonated the night.</p><p>"Aradhya, are you awake?" came James voice from outside the room amidst his thumping of the door.&nbsp;</p><p>I gathered my courage and replied from a dry throat ,"Yeah".</p><p>My voice croaked and that made him sense my fear as he again asked ,"Are you all right?"</p><p>"Yeah I'm fine", I said, this time more firmly and stood up to reach the door.</p><p>I switched on the light and came out of the room. Ahead in the corridor I saw James rushing towards the staircase. Agastya was standing at the head of the stairs wearing a pink night suit. He seemed abashed and as I looked down in the sitting room, I saw Leil standing there. This infuriated me, even at this moment he was worried about the colour of his night suit!</p><p>Therefore as I passed, I gave him a cold look which to my surprise affected him and he followed me downstairs.</p><p>Professor and Leilani were talking quite excitedly.&nbsp;</p><p>"Papa, this is strange", said Leil ,"that howl !" </p><p>She was unable to say any more and stared openmouthed at Professor who was walking to and fro.</p><p>"Where is Shiv?" James asked me.</p><p>I looked around and found that she was nowhere. I remember her lying in this room when I bade her 'good night'. We had been playing cards for late in the night and after returning from the farm she had soon went to sleep. Untill we felt sleepy enough to make our way to our rooms she had come downstairs.</p><p>It can't be that she couldn't have heard that evil howl. So where she was? This made an unpleasant feeling rise in the pit of my stomach and I grew impatient.</p><p>"Something very grave..." started Professor.</p><p>"Where's Shiv?" I cut in. Professor looked irritated at the interruption but the other second he went pale. That look on his face froze me and an ominous fear griped my body.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Suddenly Professor rushed through the long windows out into the lawn and shouted ,"I search here Leil you look the other side". Agastya and James ran out with her and I followed Professor.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Professor excitedly looked around in the dark and suddenly dashed towards the forest saying ,"This is not good".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">I knew that it was his Norman powers that had guided him towards the place where he ran so furiously. He must have catched some scent. I tried to keep up with his fabulous speed through the forest.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Suddenly he came to a halt and I almost bumped into him. I strained my eyes and my heart stopped as I saw someone lying on the floor. I stepped forward but Professor held my hand and said ,"Stop!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Uncomprihendingly I looked at him and he pointed his finger in the dark. I looked at the place near the person lying and saw an irregular silhoutte. The clouds drifted in the sky, pushed by the cold night wind and moonlight shone on the scene.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">There on the soft grass lay Shiv, motionless. A sickening pain wringed my body and tear drops trickled down my cheek. But what numbed my senses was the presence of the beast beside my dear.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">That coal black creature sat pleasantly beside her and stared at us with it's black eyes. It infuriated me to think that this creature hurt my friend.</span></p><p>My anger vapourised my fear and I stode forward to where Shiv lay. I had thought the beast to attack me as well but it didn't stir as I approached it. So I went a little more closer to her and sat down.&nbsp;</p><p>I turned to look at Professor. He hadn't moved from his place and his eyes were focused on the creature. I couldn't comprehend his unnatural interest in the animal.</p><p>I raised my trembling hand and checked Shiv's pulse. It was normal but she breathed heavily.&nbsp;</p><p>"She's fainted", I stated.&nbsp;</p><p>At that moment some footsteps echoed in the night and others dashed out of the forest into the clearing.</p><p>Leil bolted to a halt with an immensely surprised expression, her eyes riveted at the creature. Whereas Agastya slowly came to stand beside me and asked ,"Is she unconsious?"&nbsp;</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>James almost ran to sit beside Shiv and he instantly held her hand for pulse. In the bright moonlight his face looked so ghastly that I feared he would also faint. But his iron nerve held until he knew that Shiv was just unconsious. He immediately lifted her up in his arms and as he started towards the house, the creature also stood up from it's seated position and started to follow him.</p><p>Untill we reached the house everybody was silent.&nbsp;</p><p>"It was Cecile", said Professor looking outside of the windows as the cat slowly retreated into the woods.&nbsp;</p><p>"He tried to choke her out!" hissed James angrily as he stroked the black lines at Shiv's throat.&nbsp;</p><p>I gently slipped a pillow below her head as she lay on the sofa. Her ghastly pallor made me sick. Tears blurring my vision, I felt Leil's hand patting on my shoulder.</p><p>"I thought you said we were safe here", said James staring at the opposite wall.&nbsp;</p><p>"I said you were safer here than on Earth.....I know it's hard.....when it's not even your fault", said Professor a little embarressed.</p><p>"We thought as much Professor", I said in a wavering voice. It infuriated me to be so weak, when tears rolled my cheeks.</p><p>James took a deep breath and looking back at us again asked ,"Why were you so struck by that cat?"</p><p>"It's not just a cat.....it's an omen", said Leil ,"We are not superstitious", she clarified as James raised an eyebrow "It's just that we have some old tales".</p><p>She took a deep breath and plunged into the story ,"The cat is from a kind of creatures who are called Obsidians. These are just normal creatures of any planet who have got a power to predict future.</p><p>"No one knows how they are able to do it. Once an intelligent creature, actually a human, has become an Obsidian. This was not very far back in the history, just after the war ended. Council has always kept a watchful eye over the universe and usually keeps records of Obsidians as they are crutial and are centre of lot of unwanted attention.&nbsp;</p><p>"So as soon as it was known what she was, the members of the Council went up to her. And the interview revealed the workings of the prophecy creation. Which was not much as she herself didn't know much. She said she saw pictures of future at any time, there wasn't any pattern and it happened to her from her birth.</p><p>"At present there are only two Obsidians present. One is this cat and the other one is a creature from a very underdeveloped civilisation. He is of not much use. But this cat has been a very special one. It can communicate through visions.&nbsp;</p><p>"A lot of notorious forces were behind the power it held, when suddenly about twelve years ago it disappeared. Nobody knew where it went and a lot of people were finding it but no one ever got a clue. Today when I saw it there....out of all the places.....beside my house.....it was a shock."</p><p>"It harmed her?" I asked, this time in a steadied voice.</p><p>"The creature's very benevolent. It actually saved her from Cecile and howled to wake us up." said Professor gravely.</p><p>I felt gratitude for the cat and guilty for being angry. As my mind got calmer, I realised why Professor was so intent on taking us away from the Earth. Norma was a place where we were constantly under Professor's and Leil's guard. But still we got attacked, I didn't even want to imagine what Apeirog could do on Earth. Probably it didn't need much imagination, everything would have ended on that first day in that cave.</p><p>"Now only time travel is left to do!" said Agastya and I gave out a laugh that abruptly stopped in midway.</p><p>"It's all right now, you should go back to your rooms", said James in a less angry voice. He was always so vulnerable when it comes to Shiv.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's about dawn, I can't openly investigate......but I'm going to track Cecile and his party down", said Leil and rushed to her room. I remembered that this whole matter was about something that can't be brought before the Council, that's why Apeirog was carrying out his wishes so freely.</p><p>"I'll stay and see if father is contactable", mused Professor and turned to his room.&nbsp;</p><p>I slowly trudged to the kitchen. A cool splash of water on my face was relieving. I sighed audibly and told myself not to be childish. Shiv was always the strong one between us but sometimes, mostly when it was about her, I was the one who talked sensibly. To others she looked very confident and self sufficient but I knew how she struggled with her complex. Initially when we were students, we have been friends since childhood, she was very dubious about herself and I helped her in realising what she was capable of, b<span style="font-size: 1rem;">ut most of the times she was my support stick.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">I told myself that this was about her and I've got to be strong.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Shouldn't have joked", Agastya almost startled me. His grave expression was in conflict with his pink dress.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Not really", I said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"What do you mean by that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Sometimes....no mostly your jokes are irritating", his face dropped a little ,"but we need your jokes at times when smiling is as hard as living".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">He smiled wryly. He is a jovial person through and through but that day I saw a gravity inside him. I never thought he was capable of that but surely that was an underestimation of his personality.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I smiled at the thought of telling Shiv about Agastya being a mature person. That was surely going to give her a decent laugh.</p><p>"Okay I'll give you a favor. Go outside, I'll make the tea", he said. I raised my eyebrows in an attempt of mockery (he rolled his eyes) and went outside.</p><p>I came out in the sitting room just as Leil's craft dashed upwards in the sky. Professor has become a part of our family, so the thought that he was an extraterrestrial entity never came into our minds. The proof was that we still called him 'Professor'. His concern for us seemed only natural. But Leil was an outsider and it was comforting to think that she was worried about our safety.</p><p>The room was empty, James must have strolled out in the fresh air. "Good for him," I thought and saw that Shiv was sleeping peacefully on the sofa. Her breath was even and the colour of her face has somewhat returned.&nbsp;</p><p>I went up to her side and sat down looking outside at the front lawn. "How Cecile would have lured her?" I thought. Only possible solution was that he must have impersonated into one of us. Why would she meet to any stranger when she knew it could be dangerous?&nbsp;</p><p>I really doubted that it all will end soon. I was worried about how much time we will have to spend and how many wounds we will have to endure untill we will be free of this mess? But I was sure of one thing, untill we will stick together, everything would be well.</p><p>I suddenly remembered about our families. I knew it will be sometime before we will return to Earth, what will be our excuse?</p><p>Agastya put the tray on the table and asked, "Where's Jamiee?"</p><p>"Maybe outside." I said picking my cup.</p></div>
