            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>I woke up with a start. A deafening howl pierced the silence of the night and I sat upright in the bed, my heart thumping like a drum. I dared not to imagine the creature whose throat produced the sound. I sat staring in the dark for sometime when again the howl resonated the night.</p><p>"Aradhya, are you awake?" came James voice from outside the room amidst his thumping of the door.&nbsp;</p><p>I gathered my courage and replied from a dry throat ,"Yeah".</p><p>My voice croaked and that made him sense my fear as he again asked ,"Are you all right?"</p><p>"Yeah I'm fine", I said, this time more firmly and stood up to reach the door.</p><p>I switched on the light and came out of the room. Ahead in the corridor I saw James rushing towards the staircase. Agastya was standing at the head of the stairs wearing a pink night suit. He seemed abashed and as I looked down in the sitting room, I saw Leil standing there. This infuriated me, even at this moment he was worried about the colour of his night suit!</p><p>Therefore as I passed, I gave him a cold look which to my surprise affected him and he followed me downstairs.</p><p>Professor and Leilani were talking quite excitedly.&nbsp;</p><p>"Papa, this is strange", said Leil ,"that howl !" </p><p>She was unable to say any more and stared openmouthed at Professor who was walking to and fro.</p><p>"Where is Shiv?" James asked me.</p><p>I looked around and found that she was nowhere. I remember her lying in this room when I bade her 'good night'. We had been playing cards for late in the night and after returning from the farm she had soon went to sleep. Untill we felt sleepy enough to make our way to our rooms she had come downstairs.</p><p>It can't be that she couldn't have heard that evil howl. So where she was? This made an unpleasant feeling rise in the pit of my stomach and I grew impatient.</p><p>"Something very grave..." started Professor.</p><p>"Where's Shiv?" I cut in. Professor looked irritated at the interruption but the other second he went pale. That look on his face froze me and an ominous fear griped my body.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Suddenly Professor rushed through the long windows out into the lawn and shouted ,"I search here Leil you look the other side". Agastya and James ran out with her and I followed Professor.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Professor excitedly looked around in the dark and suddenly dashed towards the forest saying ,"This is not good".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">I knew that it was his Norman powers that had guided him towards the place where he ran so furiously. He must have catched some scent. I tried to keep up with his fabulous speed through the forest.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Suddenly he came to a halt and I almost bumped into him. I strained my eyes and my heart stopped as I saw someone lying on the floor. I stepped forward but Professor held my hand and said ,"Stop!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Uncomprihendingly I looked at him and he pointed his finger in the dark. I looked at the place near the person lying and saw an irregular silhoutte. The clouds drifted in the sky, pushed by the cold night wind and moonlight shone on the scene.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">There on the soft grass lay Shiv, motionless. A sickening pain wringed my body and tear drops trickled down my cheek. But what numbed my senses was the presence of the beast beside my dear.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">That coal black creature sat pleasantly beside her and stared at us with it's black eyes. It infuriated me to think that this creature hurt my friend.</span></p><p>My anger vapourised my fear and I stode forward to where Shiv lay. I had thought the beast to attack me as well but it didn't stir as I approached it. So I went a little more closer to her and sat down.&nbsp;</p><p>I turned to look at Professor. He hadn't moved from his place and his eyes were focused on the creature. I couldn't comprehend his unnatural interest in the animal.</p><p>I raised my trembling hand and checked Shiv's pulse. It was normal but she breathed heavily.&nbsp;</p><p>"She's fainted", I stated.&nbsp;</p><p>At that moment some footsteps echoed in the night and others dashed out of the forest into the clearing.</p><p>Leil bolted to a halt with an immensely surprised expression, her eyes riveted at the creature. Whereas Agastya slowly came to stand beside me and asked ,"Is she unconsious?"&nbsp;</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>James almost ran to sit beside Shiv and he instantly held her hand for pulse. In the bright moonlight his face looked so ghastly that I feared he would also faint. But his iron nerve held until he knew that Shiv was just unconsious. He immediately lifted her up in his arms and as he started towards the house, the creature also stood up from it's seated position and started to follow him.</p><p>Untill we reached the house everybody was silent.&nbsp;</p><p>"It was Cecile", said Professor looking outside of the windows as the cat slowly retreated into the woods.&nbsp;</p><p>"He tried to choke her out!" hissed James angrily as he stroked the black lines at Shiv's throat.&nbsp;</p><p>I gently slipped a pillow below her head as she lay on the sofa. Her ghastly pallor made me sick. Tears blurring my vision, I felt Leil's hand patting on my shoulder.</p><p>"I thought you said we were safe here", said James staring at the opposite wall.&nbsp;</p><p>"I said you were safer here than on Earth.....I know it's hard.....when it's not even your fault", said Professor a little embarressed.</p><p>"We thought as much Professor", I said in a wavering voice. It infuriated me to be so weak, when tears rolled my cheeks.</p><p>James took a deep breath and looking back at us again asked ,"Why were you so struck by that cat?"</p><p>"It's not just a cat.....it's an omen", said Leil ,"There</p></div>
