            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>"It was the normal rehearsed scene, obviously with no results", said Marjorie. She was sitting in a white leather high backed chair. Her eyes on an old man in ochre unstitched clothes. He nodded in apprehension and asked, "Did you find who tipped the workers?"</p><p>"No," she stated in finality as if that very word had ended that conversation many times before.&nbsp;</p><p>The room was in the rear of a large cigar shaped spacecraft that sailed at unimaginable speed through space. Some workers were busy at piloting the craft in it's cockpit. Everyone was not working honestly though, for example a guy who was positioned in the corner was busy writing texts to someone dear (this was evident as he was smiling a lot) and the girl next to him suspected so but she kept silence.</p><p>&nbsp;I&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 1rem;">In one of the dozen rooms of the craft, Osvald was impatiently scuffling through data on a wide glass screen. He switched through different screens, hitting the buttons on the panel with unnecessary force. A plump brown girl, wearing a dress stitched of soft ochre cloth, who was working on another handheld screen looked up momentarily at him and shook her head. She came forward, pushing Osvald aside, she found the required data in a few swift habitual movements.</span></p><p>"Can't you make them more accessible?", grunted Osvald.</p><p>"They are in the foremost folder of K drive", she said absently while gazing down on her screen, "Now where you want me to put them, in your lap!."</p><p>Irritatedly Osvald returned to the screen and transferred the data in his personal folder.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm going to brief the master", he announced in a little prudent way. </p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Before going out, he shrugged his fine dress and hair. Then with a self important air he went away.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Idiot!", said Ira behing his back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;II&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Osvald left the room in a nervous fit. Marjorie smiled silently, she was accustommed to this kind of lack of attention of people in her mesmerising presence. She even enjoyed it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Someone tipped Osvald that Damion has been to Thard", said Thaddeus gravely.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Marjorie emerging from her thoughts said, "You know what it means".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Yes, he will soon know that it has been removed from Earth, given the added benefit that he knows he only has to search at those places where Xahvier visited".&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Even though it will take some time", thought Marjorie. It took years for them to find it. "Long before he will realise that, we will have it safe at Carpathia", she thought smugly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">A voice sounded in the room, "Master Xahvier is wants to talk to master Thaddeus".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Bring him on the line", said Thaddeus.</span></p><p>After a beep, Xahvier's voice echoed in the room, "Father where are you?"</p><p>"On the way to Norma, is anything amiss", said Thaddeus thinking about the urgency in the voice of his son.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Marjorie sat erect and her hand habitually trailed to her chin, she also sensed the stress in his voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"There's been an attack!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Is everyone safe?", jumped in Marjorie.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Yes, but there's more......we saw the Obisidian."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Marjorie gave out a small gasp. She said thinking, "The news must have reached Apeirog. Cecile was behind the attack?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Hmm, yes," replied Xahvier.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Did it communicate?" asked Thaddeus.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"We don't know. There may have been......I'll explain when you'll return".</span></p><p>Xahvier ended the call. Marjorie looked at Thaddeus with strained eyes, her forehead curved in soft lines. Thaddeus was gazing at the opposite wall, apparently lost in thought.</p></div>
