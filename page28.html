            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>Osvald nearly ran towards the closing automatic metal door, "Nasty things, always closes when you need to go in", he mumured panting once he was inside the long stone corridor. He was fervently striding forward thinking what Madame Marjorie will think, if not for that stupid girl who always forgets things he wouldn't have been late, not if it was for Madame Marjorie. </p><p>On reaching in front of the huge beautifully carved wooden gate he abruptly came to a halt. Briefly he looked at his embroidered white satin clothe that wrapped his lean figure. He rubbed off the tiniest speck of dust from his wrist and caressed his gown to flatten the imaginary creases. Finally he got convinced that he was attired in the best of clothes that any Norman would have dreamt of and his lips curved in a self appraising smile.</p><p>He knocked softly on the gate precisely twice. Slowly it opened. He stepped inside.</p><p>The gate closed itself behind his back.&nbsp;</p><p>"Osvald, where've you been", said a beautiful lustious female voice.</p><p>"Madame, just some petty nuances this morning held me back." he said, his eyes locked on the beautiful lady in front of him. The room in which he found himself was a huge one. It's high ceiling was decorated with a magnificent chandelier that slightly shimmered in the soft morning light entering from the large windows. The room was lavishly furnitured, a magneficent mirror stood in a corner, there were several high backed comfortable chairs and glass vases. Everything about the room was fragile and brittle but beautiful including the lady that stood in front of Osvald.</p><p>Marjorie was an exceptional beauty. She was wearing a pale blue gown that wrapped around her body in soft curves. Her long golden hair that reached up to her waist surrounded her in lavish curls. Her whiter than snow skin looked almost transparent and was in deep contrast with her black eyes. She had fixed her gaze on Osvald who seemed to be holding his breath. She smiled and looked away.</p><p>Osvald awaking from his reverie stammered out,"Mmm...master is also here, he wants to meet you".</p><p>"Bring him here", she said. Osvald retreated hastily.</p><p>The door opened again and Osvald came following a saint like man who was draped in a crude ochre clothe. His long white beard reached to his belly and his brown forehead was creased. His head was bowed down on his chest.&nbsp;</p><p>Marjorie turned around and said,"Thaddeus a..." she stopped as she saw the frowning look at his face and then started again, "What's it?....... Zahvier came back from Earth. Didn't he?"</p><p>"Hmm", he said in a husky voice, "Osvald will you....". Osvald went out of the room.</p><p>"Zahvier found it", he said ,"but Apeirog has been on Earth."</p><p>Marjorie's face lightened up and then suddenly hardened as the sentence progressed.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's just impossible! No one knows about this except you, me and your son", she said in a soft voice.</p><p>"Leil also, but that's not the matter. The good thing is that he doesn't know that we found it. When he captured Zahvier, he kept asking him about it's location........He knows that we can't approach the Council in this matter so his notoriety has no bounds", he said in an exasperated tone. His peaceful demeanour cracking in places.</p><p>Marjorie considered it for a moment and then asked ,"Where's it? At Norma?"</p><p>"That's why I'm here. I want you to safelock it here, at Carpathia.....as soon as you can."</p><p>She nodded. "I'll come to collect it soon".</p></div>
