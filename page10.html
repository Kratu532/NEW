            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>"Happy birthday!!!!", came a noise from behind. Startled Shiv turned her chair and what was that, James, Aradhya and Mrs. Mufti were standing there wearing birthday caps and holding balloons. (In that noise, Agastya woke up suddenly and fell out of his chair). Mrs. Mufti looked like a clown, Shiv thought and wondered how she agreed for that plan of her friends.</p><p>At the same time she was both surprised and happy. Actually she had herself forgot about her birthday in solving these ever increasing mysteries.</p><p>"Happy birthday child, may the God grace upon you," blessed Mrs. Mufti. "Ya, gimme my homework back", yawned Agastya and stetched himself. But suddenly he realised what's happening and wished greetings to Shiv. "You've been sleeping", said Aradhya looking scornfully at Agastya.&nbsp;</p><p>"Leave Aradhya, come Shiv", said James and he lead everyone to the lab room. There he opened the cake box on the table, lit a candle on it and let out a knife towards the birthday girl. "How old are you now?", asked Agastya. "24, bit old isn't it?", smiled Shiv.&nbsp;</p><p>She blew the candles. Everyone chorused the birthday song.&nbsp;</p><p>After this little party was over, Mrs. Mufti cleared the table and went back to the quarters.&nbsp;</p><p>"Where is Mr. Hans", enquired Shiv. "He is sleeping and I don't want him to ruin our happiness", said Aradhya with a frown over her face. Shiv thought about what she had seen an hour ago and decided to disscuss it later in the day. "Now you both go and rest, we will manage here", said Shiv. "Have a cup of coffee and don't doze off again", said Aradhya handing a cup off coffee to Agastya. And they both went away. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Shiv was standing outside the observatory facing the rising sun. The sun gleaming in her eyes and her hairs flapped against her face in the cool, chilly morning breeze. The town in the valley beneath looked so beautiful. The pine trees were adorned with cold pearls and it seemed that the sunlight was trying to steal these pearls from them.&nbsp;</p><p>She felt very sleepy. James was heading straight to her. "Go and have rest", said he.</p><p>Shiv slept till late in the afternoon. She stood up, got ready and went downstairs in the hall. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What's in the lunch grandma", she enquired. "All your favourites", replied Mrs. Mufti. By the time table was ready, Agastya was also downstairs. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Any news from the officials about professor Sawhney", asked Shiv. "Nothing", said agastya, "but I have hopes that soon there will be a clarification. By the way there's an order from your parents, maybe a present, it's in my room, take it when you please". &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Agastya I'm going to the town, will you come", asked Shiv. "No, I have work to do. Why are you going there?", &nbsp;asked Agastya. "Just for a stroll", said Shiv. Actually she had made up her mind to talk to the people of the town about professor Sawhney. She hoped to find why he visited so frequently there.</p><p>She was standing at the entrane of that small town facing north. Behind her was a long winding road that lead to the city of himanchal, the hill station. At the west of the town was the cliff at which was the observatory was situated. From all the other sides the town was surounded with hills and mountains. At the north east from the entrance, the cave mountain was visible.&nbsp;</p><p>She walked in a small teashop and sat on a table under the shed. The eveninng hasn't arrived yet but the mountains shadowed the whole town and it was hard to believe that it was still 3:00. She sat in a corner and started looking around. The teashop boy put a cup of steaming tea in front of her and went away. She took a sip and it felt the best thing ever in this cold. </p><p>Suddenly her eyes fell upon a group of villagers who sat grouped around a man whose face was concieled behind a black <em>shawl</em>. This group was sitting beside the wall of the teashop in front of her, not far away so that she could hear what they were talking. </p><p>That man was sitting huddled up and was smoking <em>hookah</em>. Behind the curtain of smoke and black <em>shawl</em>&nbsp;a harsh voice came as if lost in a deep thought, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>"I'll tell you how it happened. It was a dark and foggy night, shivering cold. I was sleeping beside my bonefire in that cave. Suddenly a voice came, humming voice, then a thud as if something has fallen and some footsteps and it was all silent again. I stood up, took a log from the fire and went towards the source of the noice. And there was nothing, absolutely nothing." &nbsp; </em>"What do you think was there?", said one of the listners. "A ghost stupid", said the other. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>"</em>&nbsp;<em>I</em></p></div>
