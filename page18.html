The hall was mostly empty, only a large stone throne stood erect on a platform facing the entrance. The hall contained numerous large windows that spanned the whole length of the wall, on left and front wall. The right wall was decorated with large portraits of pale skinned men who had piercing blue eyes and large bony faces. Their cold eyes stared tirelessly out of the windows and their lips were curved in the same sneer that curved the perfect features of Apeirog.</p><p>He was looking out of a window at the cold, snow covered terrain that expanded beyond the horizon, apparently lost in deep thought.&nbsp;</p><p>"Why are you alone Cecile?", said Apeirog and turned to face Cecile who cowed under his murderous glare. "Mmmaster", stuttered Cecile ,"Zahvier came equipped. He had his daughter with him. I barely survived."</p><p>"Are you sure you will breath another moment in front of me after you failed this trifle task", said Apeirog in a steel voice.</p><p>"Mmaster I..I... , give me a second chance.
