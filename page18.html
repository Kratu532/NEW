</strong><div>"Now that I'm awake, I should do some work", thought Shiv and came out of her bed. She took out her laptop and started fiddling. 
</div><div><br></div><div>It's been about twenty minutes and by now she was wide awake, when she thought she heard something. It sounded like someone stepped by her door. She silently went out of her bed and moved towards the door. Quitely she peeped outside. It was Hans. She was sure she could identify his tall, erect figure even in pitch black. Now the hall was shining with moonlight and he was walking to and fro in the hall. "He is searching something", Shiv thought. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Suddenly he stopped and moved towards the long hall windows. He stood there looking outside. Shiv came out of her room and slowly moved towards left in the corridor. From there she could see what was Hans looking at. She stopped dead, someone was coming towards the house. That man came to Hans and they started talking. She couldn't hear anything.</div><div><br></div><div>"Who is this man and why are they meeting at three in the morning", she thought. 
</div><div><br></div><div>That man took out something from his pocket and handed it to Hans and then went away. Hans also turned back. Shiv swiftly ran into her room and silently closed the door. After a few seconds she again heard footsteps passing.  
</div><div><br></div><div>"Are you sure it was him", asked James.</div><div><br></div><div>"Hmm, pretty sure", replied Shiv. They were in the observatory. All huddled up together to listen Shiv's story.</div><div><br></div><div>"Mark my words, he will turn out to be a ghost some day, that's why he roams in the house at nights ", remarked Agastya. Everyone stared at him. "What?" he said.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Be serious, you said he was searching something", said Aradhya.</div><div><br></div><div>"Yes, so it seemed.",Shiv said, "And I'm wondering what that man gave him."
</div><div><br></div><div>At that moment Hans entered, he didn't gave so much as a glance to them and went straight to his office, shutting the door behind him.
</div><div><br></div><div>"It could be that Hans meets this man often, I mean in the backyard, he doesn't go only to smoke.... maybe to meet this man", suggested Aradhya.</div><div><br></div><div>"Yes it could be," said James, "but why?"
</div><div><br></div><div>It was about four in the evening. Sky was clear and sunshine was entering in the observatory. Agastya and Aradhya were at the house for lunch. Hans was in his office. Shiv was brooding over some papers of recent research and James was busy with the telescope. He was adjusting some equipments and was humming a tune. Classics were his favourite, he once told Shiv. This reminded her of Professor Sawhney. "I like old hindi songs", Professor had told, his face brightening at a sudden pleasure,"Old melodies....".
</div><div><br></div><div>"Bzzz...Bzzzz", James' phone started vibrating.</div><div><br></div><div>"Look who's it, Shiv", said James over his shoulder.</div><div><br></div><div>"Hmm", Shiv said, "Hello".
</div><div><br></div><div>"Jaaamess", said the voice.
</div><div><br></div><div>"No, Shiv here", she corrected.
</div><div><br></div><div>"SHIV, it's me Sawhney", said the voice. 
</div><div><br></div><div>"PROFESSOR, how are you.. where are....", stuttered Shiv. Until now James had come over to her.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Lis..ten to me", Professor cut in,"I can't.. tell you where I am.. , but don't worry I'm safe. I want you to do something for me....."
</div><div><br></div><div>"Yes Professor"
</div><div><br></div><div>"Find that pen... you get it, THAT pen. Find it before they get it. I'll have to go.....they are following me........"
</div><div><br></div><div>"Are you all right Professor?"
</div><div><br></div><div>"I don't know, at least not untill you find it.....and yes don't try to contact me.... I'll contact you...."
</div><div><br></div><div>"Pro..., it's disconnected", said Shiv. She felt a lump in her throat, her eyes wet. 
</div><div><br></div><div>James put a hand on her shoulder and said," Is he all right?"
</div><div><br></div><div>"He said so. He said to find that pen", Shiv said.</div><div><br></div><div>"Maybe because of that storage device in it", mumbled James.</div><div><br></div><div>"Hmm, he referred to some 'they' who were following him.... He is in danger."
</div><div><br></div><div>"What could be in that pen?", asked Agastya.</div><div><br></div><div>"Something that could put Professor's life in danger", said Aradhya "something for which he can put his life in danger.......we'll have to find it."
</div><div><br></div><div>"But we have already searched his room and his office, where else we look", said Agastya.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Those are the places where everyone will search, remember those officials, if Professor is sure that when they searched, they didn't get it then definitely he didn't hide it there. Let's search the house." suggested Aradhya.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>"Are you talking about this pen", said Hans. He was standing in front of them holding the pen in his ourstretched hand and smiling curtly. 
</div><div><br></div><div>"What was this supposed to mean", thought Shiv. Should she be afraid that Hans got that pen and whatever it enshroudes before them or should she be delighted that it is better that he got it rather than those people whom Professor feared. Before she could make up her mind Hans spoke again ,"I overheard what you were talking, so finally Sawhney called you all even after my prohibition".
</div><div><br></div><div>"What! Why will you restrict him from doing anything? What have you got to do with all this?", asked James rather puzzled by the turn of the situation.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Listen young man, Sawhney is my best friend and whatever concerns him concerns me as well", said Hans with an offended expression. "I think that I should explain myself", he added.
</div><div><br></div><div>"You better!", said Agastya.
</div><div><br></div><div>Without paying any attention to Agastya's rather seething remark, Hans started with his story,   "On the evening of June 30, I got an email from the ISRO about my transfer, here in Shambala, which puzzled me a lot because Sawhney was already here. I thought that maybe he left for some personal reasons. Actually we weren't in contact for someti..."
</div><div><br></div><div>"You weren't informed that he got arrested", cut in Aradhya.
</div><div><br></div><div>"No, and don't interupt," said Hans making a face ,"I had only three days to report here so I set out at once. When I reached here you asked me about his arrest which put me off guard, because whatever I expected I never expected this," he paused here to think something and then continued ,"Later I tried to call the authorities for further information but they replied vaguely saying about some confidential information and all that. Frustated, I left the attempt and went in the backyard for some fresh air, I had strolled some way in the forest when I saw him coming, Sawhney I mean." here he stopped enjoying the look on their faces as they all looked at him openmouthed, stunned. He really was a man who enjoyed surprising people. After about a minute he started again rather sadly ,"I was sorry to see him in that haggard state. He almost ran to me and said ,' I know you want to ask me a lot of questions but I don't have time. I have to find something very important.' Then he told me that he escaped from the officials with some outside help. I told him, in that case he shouldn't be seen anywhere near Shambala. Then finally he told me to find this pen and keep it until he gets a chance to get hold of it and I sent him to a cottage of my friend, which is nearby, to hide." 
</div><div><br></div><div>"You knew about him all this time and you didn't bother to tell us!", said Aradhya angrily.
</div><div><br></div><div>"It was him who told me not to 'bother myself' by telling you all this. He said it is quite dangerous but now that he called you himself, I see no objection on his part in telling you after all." he stopped watching intently at their faces then continued ,"Well, he called me later in the night and told me that this pen had a storage device in which he had got something very important. He also felt that all contact mediums to the observatory were under surveillance from after his dissapearance so he said that he will send Ram, the caretaker of the cottage, with letters for further contact. After that I set out to search, carefully keeping check that none of you suspect anything. The other night I went to his office to search there. Initially I thought that no one was there expect Agastya who was deepily in sleep when later I got to know that Shiv was keeping a watch at me," he smiled at her, visibily amused that he knew her secret ,"but for days I got nothing when tonight Ram again came with a letter." he showed them that letter.
</div><div><br></div><div>It ran thus:
</div><div>A.H., I think you should search the basement again. It had to be there, maybe Mrs. M. would have kept my things there. Yes, look in the wooden trunk thorougly again. Tommorow meet me in the forest at three . I think I will have to leave soon.  
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A.S.
</div><div><br></div><div>"I searched the trunk where in his trouser pockets I got this." finished Hans.
</div><div><br></div><div>"We will accompany you in the forest tonight," said Shiv and she went out in the garden.</div></div>
