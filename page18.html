            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>Apeirog was standing in a large hall. It was made of black stone with high arched ceiling. The hall was mostly empty, only a large stone throne stood erect on a platform facing the entrance. The hall contained numerous large windows that spanned the whole length of the wall, on left and front wall. The right wall was decorated with large portraits of pale skinned men who had piercing blue eyes and large bony faces. Their cold eyes stared tirelessly out of the windows and their lips were curved in the same sneer that curved the perfect features of Apeirog.</p><p>He was looking out of a window at the cold, snow covered terrain that expanded beyond the horizon, apparently lost in deep thought.&nbsp;</p><p>"Why are you alone Cecile?", said Apeirog and turned to face Cecile who cowed under his murderous glare. "Mmmaster", stuttered Cecile ,"Zahvier came equipped. He had his daughter with him. I barely survived."</p><p>"Are you sure you will breath another moment in front of me after you failed this trifle task", said Apeirog in a steel voice.</p><p>"Mmaster I..I... , give me a second chance. This time..."</p><p>"This time you won't fail. Is that what you want to say?", said Apeirog, "You can't even imagine with your small brain what will happen if the Council gets to know about this. All these years of work....my position in the Council....everything will be ruined."</p><p>He stared at the portraits of his ancestors who held the position as the members of the esteemed Council. Apeirog has always dreamed of this, his whole life. He wanted to feel that power himself, being an advisor was not enough for him.</p><p>He eyes habitually trailed towards the portrait that seemed to be the most untattered. His whole body shook in disgust at the face of his father's image which reminded him again why, even after so many accomplishes, he can't be the member of the Council.</p><p>Full of anger he strided towards Cecile, his cloak swaying behind him like a shadow, and lifted him by throat in the air. "Kill them or kill yourself! But don't return here failed", he hissed between his sharp white teeth.&nbsp;</p><p>He loosened his grip and Cecile disappeared in air leaving a cough echoing behind him.</p><p>At that instant footsteps sounded in the hall and Apeirog turned to meet the visitor.</p><p>"Damion!", he said. His features relaxed a bit.</p><p>A young, paper white man entered the hall. He was clad in the same black cloak that seemed to be the staple of Corvians. His long, black hairs fell over his shoulders and his blue eyes shined as his gaze met with that of Apeirog's.</p><p>"Father", he said in a smooth icy voice ,"you returned early."</p><p>"Yes my son.", said Apeirog ,"I am leaving again for the Council, there are some matters that needs to be addressed."</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">He moved towards Damion and put a hand on his shoulder and said ,"I want you to find it for me. We don't have time".&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Damion nodded to the disappearing figure of Apeirog.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">He stood alone in the hall for sometime and heaved a deep sigh. Then he walked out of the hall and came out into a large,dimly lit sitting room. The house was carved out of the same black stone in contrast to the white snow that wailed outside. The sitting room was furnished with a pair of sofa around a black stone table. Several other antique articles decorated the rest of the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">He went up to a large portrait that hung at the wall opposite to the hall entrance.</span></p><p>The portrait was of a young lady clad in a black cloak. Her knee long hairs fell over her body and her snow white face peeped out of the black surroundings. A faint smiled played at her lips. A pair of beautiful blue eyes looked at him. "Mother", wisphered Damion.</p><p>A tall figure moved towards him out of darkness. "Master, will you have something?", said the man with a quivering voice that perfectly matched with his wrinkled face and trembling hands. His hands folded in front of him were like white snowballs covered with black satin.&nbsp;</p><p>"No, Tressilian. Just pack my things", said Damion.</p><p>"Master's going out." said Tressilian.</p><p>"Yes", replied Damion and then murmured to himself ,"for a long time."</p></div>
