I understand the sentiment behind the saying, but it's wrong. I entered the building on a bet. I was strapped for cash and didn't buy into the old legends of the hotel to begin with, so fifty bucks was more than enough to get me do it. It was simple. Just reach the top floor, the 45th floor, shine my flashlight from a window. The hotel was old and broken, including the elevator, so that meant hiking up the stairs. So up the stairs I went. As I reached each platform, I noted the old brass plates displaying the floor numbers.&nbsp; 15, 16, 17, 18. I felt a little tired as I crept higher, but so far, no ghosts, no cannibals, no demons. Piece of cake. I can't tell you how happy I was as I entered that last stretch of numbers. I joyfully counted them aloud at each platform.&nbsp; 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 44. I stopped and looked back down the stairs. I must have miscounted, so I continued up. 44. One more flight. 44. And then down ten flights. 44. Fifteen flights. 44. And so it's been for as long as I can remember. So really, insanity isn't doing something repeatedly and expecting different results. It's knowing that the results will never ever change; that each door leads to the same staircase, to the same number. It's realizing you no longer fall asleep. It's not knowing whether you've been running for days or weeks or years. It's when the sobbing slowly turns into laughter.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>'Hell' by reddit user MeanPete</strong></p><p>There was no pearly gate. The only reason I knew I was in a cave was because I had just passed the entrance. The rock wall rose behind me with no ceiling in sight. I knew this was it, this was the what religion talked about, what man feared....... I had just entered the gate to hell. I felt the presence of the cave as if it was a living, breathing creature. The stench of rotten flesh overwhelmed me. Then there was the voice, it came form inside and all around. "Welcome". "Who are you?", I asked trying to keep my composure. "You know", the thing answered. I did know. "You are the devil", I stuttered, quickly losing my composure. "Why me? I've lived as good as I could". The silence took over the space as my words died out. It seemed like an hour went by before the response came. "What did you expect?" The voice was penetrating but patient. "I don't know...... I never believed any of this", I uttered. "Is that why I'm here?" Silence. I continued: "They say the greatest trick you ever pulled was convincing the world you don't exist."&nbsp; "No. The greatest trick I ever pulled was convincing the world that there is an alternative". "There is no God?," I shivered. The cave trembled with the words: "I am God".</p><p><br></p><p><strong>'Vampire' by reddit user IPostAtMidnight</strong></p><p>Have you ever walked into a room and found a vampire? No, not the the sexy kind, but a foul creature with bony limbs and ashen skin? The kind that snarls as you enter, like a beast about to pounce? The kind that roots you to the spot with it's sunken, hypnotic eyes, rendering you unable to flee as you watch the hideous thing uncoil from the shadows? Has your heart started racing though your legs refuse to? Have you felt time slow as the creature crosses the room in the darkness of a blink? Have you shuddered with fear when it places one clawed hand atop your head and another under your chin so it can tilt you, exposing your neck? Have you squirmed as it's rough, dry tongue slides down your cheek, over your jaw, to your throat, in a slithering search that's seeking your artery? Have you felt it's hot breath release in a hiss against your skin when it probes your pulse-the flow that leads to your brain? Has it's tongue rested there, throbbing slightly as if savouring the moment? Have you then experienced a sinking, sucking blackness as you discover that not all vampires feed on blood-some feed on memories? Well, have you? Maybe not. But let me rephrase the question: Have you ever walked into a room and suddenly forgotten why you came in?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>'The Brave Ones' by reddit user scarymaxx</strong></p><p>Here they come again, the brave ones. Another Halloween night, and the kids are back, here to prove their fearlessness. The old house's floorboards creak beneath their sneakers. Only half an hour until midnight, so I have to work fast. I start with their flashlight, blowing lightly against it, so that it flickers, but this inspires little more than a nervous giggle. Fifteen minutes until midnight. Time to take things up a notch. I hover up to the ceiling, and will my body into flesh. My every nerve is on fire, but they've given me no choice. I force drops of blood to trickle out my nose, but the boys below don't notice. I knock against the ceiling, but they won't even look up. "I thought this place was supposed to be haunted", says the leader. "What a joke". Five minutes until midnight. I'm running out of time. With the last of my strength, I scream- so loud that they finally turn to look up at me. I like to think I put on a&nbsp; good show: I sway on an invisible noose, and the blood flows freely from my nostrils now. A couple of drops hit a skinny one with a crew cut. The boys scream and run into the night, just in time. Below me, I hear the Thing turn, it's disappointment palpable. For now, it sleeps. But one day, I will fail. The boys will be too brave, and I won't scare them out in time. One day they will wake it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>'New Cell Phone' by Creepypasta.fandom</strong></p><p>A couple of months ago, my friend's cousin (a single mother) bought a new cell phone. After a long day of work, she came home, placed her phone on the counter, and went to watch TV; her son came to her and asked if he could play with her new phone. She told him not to call anyone or mess with text messages, and he agreed.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">At around 11:20, she was drowsy, so she decided to tuck her son in and go to bed. She walked to his room and saw that he wasn't there. She then ran over to her room to find him sleeping on her bed with the phone in his hand.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Relieved, she picked her phone back up from his hand to inspect it. Browsing through it, she noticed only minor changes such as a new background, banner, etc., but then she opened up her saved pictures. She began deleting the pictures he had taken, until only one new picture remained.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">When she first saw it, she was in disbelief. It was her son sleeping on her bed, but the picture was taken by someone else above him....and it showed the left half of an elderly woman's face.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Some two liners by BoredPanda</strong></p><p>The last thing I saw was my alarm clock flashing 12:07 before she pushed her long rotting nails through my chest, her other hand muffling my screams. I sat bolt upright, relieved it was only a dream, but as I saw my alarm clock read 12:06, I heard my closet door creak open.</p><p>You hear your mom calling you into the kitchen. As you are heading down the stairs you hear a whispher from the closet saying "Don't go down honey, I heard it too".</p><p>Sleep did not come to me easily that night in the cabin in the woods, for the portraits on the wall only portrayed the deformed, the decrepit and the damned. Sleep has never come easily to me ever again, for when I woke I found no portraits, only windows.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Little is more freaky</strong></p><p>I said goodnight to my wife laying next to me. I rolled over and saw her standing in the doorway.</p><p>I always thought my cat had a staring problem, she always seemed fixated on my face. Until one day, when I realised that she was always looking just behind me.</p><p>The grinning face stared at me from the darkness beyond my bedroom window. I live on the fourteenth floor.</p><p>When, late at night, I found my wife weeping at the kitchen table. I asked, "Honey, what's wrong, why are you crying?" "Because", she said, and showed me the bloody knife in her hand, "no matter what I do you won't stay dead".</p><p>When I was first able to hear again after the operation, I would often talk to myself when I was alone, just to enjoy the sound in my ears. I stopped shortly after, once I started getting replies.</p><p>It's been watching me for hours now. Sometimes I catch glimpses of it's reflection on the computer screen, but I dare not turn around.</p><p>I never go to sleep but I keep waking up.</p><p>She wondered why she keeps casting two shadows after all there's only one lightbulb.</p></div>
