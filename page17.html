We're not going to a desert. We'll be fine. Our train is on schedule and we need to get ready." said Chaitra and asked Daaruk to follow. The train at the Coorg station reached and they got up.</p><p>Chaitra Arya was a young archaeologist. She was a tall lady with deep black eyes and shiny black hairs. As comfort always pleased her so she was clad in a half sleeved granny dress.</p><p>When inside the train, she called her friend cum colleague Daaruk Sage and inquired him about a diary that she always carries with her.</p><p>Daaruk, a young and fair gentleman sort of man with deep eyes and tall figure came fore and assured her that all the necessaries were already packed.</p><p>"We've all our shovels, trowels and sieves well arranged and packed, so you don't frantic", said Daaruk and settled himself in the seat opposite her. Chaitra also sat down and waved at her mother from the train window untill she was well out of sight.</p><p>She sat glacing out of the window at the sprinting trees and hills of Sringeri as cold wind battered against her face. Sringeri was a beautiful small city full of vegetation and hills and deers in the state of Karnataka.</p><p>The cool wind was playing with her hairs, tossing them here and there over her face, when she sat reminiscing the history of Sringeri, the place which is called 'the marvel of ancient history'. Here Adiguru Shankaracharya used to lecture his disciples.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a long fabled folklore that once Shankaracharya was passing by the Tunga river when he saw a black cobra who,with a raised hood, was providing shelter, from hot sun, to a frog undergoing labour. Impressed with the divinity of the place where natural enemies had gone against their instincts to help each other, he stayed there for about twelve years.&nbsp;</p><p>She took a deep breath of fresh air and wondered about the greenry of the place, such a hypnotic invitation to all those who were tired of the mechanical urban culture. When suddenly her thoughts were interrupeted by Daaruk's circumspectious question, "Why did they called us?"</p><p>"I think it must be a grave issue. Nevertheless, we will know, after this lethally long journey of thirty three hours to Mussoorie," said Chaitra smiling wryly.</p><p>"By the way, Daaruk", she continued ,"I've come across some newspaper articles. One said 'The ministry dug out at Mongs hill, Mussoorie government on the way to hide it'. "</p><p>"Now the matter is in our hands so lets see what is it." replied Daaruk with some excitement.</p><p>On reaching to Sarai Rohilla, which was tremendously surrounded by vast and huge mountains, Daaruk informed Chaitra about the security initiative adopted for them at the destined spot under the supervision of the talented and effacious officer Ahan Sardesai. He told her that Ahan was also coming to pick them up at the Mussoorie station.</p><p>"It's rather strange, all these security measures, isn't it?" said Chaitra rather vaguely. "Hmm", replied Daaruk.</p><p>It was the evening of 4th October,1979. The train halted at the Mussoorie station. As they came out at the platform they saw a tall man standing in front of them accompanied by a middle aged woman with swaggering eyes.</p><p>"Welcome!", said the man in a&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">deep voice, "I'm Ahan Sardesai, the security incharge here and this is Mrs. Daksha Mani."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">They followed them out of the station to a cab that was waiting outside and began their journey to Savoy Hotel.</span></p></div>
