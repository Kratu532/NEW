The first thing she did was to open the curtains and bow to the horizon that had started to redden. In her culture sun symbolises a divine guide that lightens the path in darkest of times.</p><p>She hastily freshened up, eager to start the investigation of her new project, and was standing with a cup of black tea when Daaruk bustled in her room.</p><p>"Good morning", she said and then sensing some underlying frustation in his face she asked ,"What's it? Why are you upset?"</p><p>Daaruk shook his head ,"It's nothing. Let's go for the breakfast."</p><p>On the ground floor, opposite to the reception table, stood open the door to a large dining hall. Daaruk and Chaitra entered. The hall was almost empty but for some early risers who were about to start their meal. The long dining table that was the centre piece of the hall was adorned with gateau, club sandwiches, canapes, some deserts along with tea and coffee for the guests. The ceiling was adorned with a beautiful chandelier and the blue tinted walls were empty except for few lamps decorated on it. The room was full of the scent of fresh wild flowers that were present in huge vases.</p><p>They took their seats and the butler served them. &nbsp;</p></div>
