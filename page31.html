            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>It's been quite sometime they've been on Norma. The special addition of daylight had caused them to break the disciplines. They slept at any odd hour and woke at the midnights. Shiv mentally calculated that at least four days would have passed on Earth. She found it very uneasy at first, sleeping at broad daylight, but if you're so sleepy that you can't even find the way to your room then sunlight doesn't matters. Does it?</p><p>So Shiv was lying on the sofa and was staring out of the wall sized windows of the sitting room. The midnight sky was full of blinking stars with the apparition of two moons slowly drifting through. The house was completely silent, others were still sleeping. Aradhya would have been awake but for the games they played late in the night, after Shiv had been asleep, that she was still in bed.</p><p>Shiv settled deeper in the pillows and blinked her eyes at the spellbounding view. She felt a little bored though. All her books, her research papers, her laptop and the smartphone, everything was at Earth. She yearned for them. Yesterday she found some paper scrolls lying in a cupboard and borrowed a pen from Leilani, and had spent hours scribbling onto it. She wondered about the huge mountain of work that would pile up during the interval they were away, and then dismissed the thought as being too stressful.</p><p>She suddenly looked behind at the noise of some footsteps, she strained her eyes in the dark but saw no one. She again resumed staring at the windows.</p><p>Sometimes the reality is stranger than fiction, she thought remembering the day when Professor had said ,<em>"Shiv, what if one day I leave this place suddenly, what will you think of me?".</em>&nbsp;That day it didn't made any sense, just a fantastic idea which occured to him as simply as other fantastic ideas of science that occurred to him so naturally. But when he got arrested, or so she thought, the sentence assumed an altogether different meaning, it meant that he had already foreseen his arrest. That made it quite a mystery, what he did that he thought he would get arrested?&nbsp;</p><p>But now she saw clearly. He knew that one day when all his work would finish, then he will have to leave. She saw his hardened face again in her thoughts, that day it made her uneasy...afraid, but now she knew it was the thought of leaving her and his little family behind, that caused him to look like that.&nbsp;</p><p>And that story, shepherds and all that.....so cleverly weaved around the local rumors...well they weren't rumors completely, maybe the noise they heard was true, men talking in different language and metal clanking......it must have been Cecile and his sidekicks. He devised it to explain his absence. Where he went during those hours? Maybe visited Norma...afterall they have superfast spacecrafts.</p><p>Shiv took a deep sigh and murmured, "It all was double edged".&nbsp;</p><p>She lied there humming for sometime when she saw a silhoutte passing against the backdrop of the forest. She sat up ,"Is someone awake?"</p><p>She stood up and searched her sneakers, it was a little discomforting to wear sneakers all the time but you have to face the consequences of making a trip in hurry, and scuffled out of the windows.&nbsp;</p><p>She shivered in the cold air as she lurched outside and rubbed her shoulders. The silhoutte was moving to and fro in front of the trees. Shiv tried to recognise the man, first she thought it to be Professor but as she drew close, the lean figure suggested otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>"Hey", she called out.</p><p>The black figure stopped moving and turned to look at her. Now Shiv was close enough to recognise him as Tamio.</p><p>"Tamio, what are you doing here at this hour?", she asked. Though she was up but it was still midnight for Normans.</p><p>Tamio looked pleased about something, he smiled widely and said ,"There's a little problem at the farms, will you come to help?"</p><p>"Now this is wierd", thought Shiv. First, is the work still going on at the farms and second he seemed to be waiting here for someone not coming over to call for help.</p><p>"How can I be of any help? I don't know a thing about all this." she said ,"You wait here, I am going in to call Leil".</p><p>She turned around and started towards the house. She was midway when she felt a prick at the base of her neck. "Ouch", she uttered and as she was about to move further but her knees gave way and she fell on the ground.</p><p>Her body felt numb and sleepy. She felt as if someone was dragging her. The house in front of her slowly crawled away...............the darkness increased.</p><p>After sometime the dragging stopped and everything went silent. Someone was around, walking with hurried footsteps. She tried to keep her eyes open but the lids felt heavy as stone. She tried to shout but the lips won't budge.&nbsp;</p><p>And then she saw Tamio looking at her, he was kneeled in front of her and his face was inches away. She tried to keep her eyes open.</p><p>"Fool!", he sneered ,"Humans are so foolish."</p><p>He hold onto her jaw and shook her face. Mocking at her incapability.</p><p>Her eyes closed momentarily but she opened them again with all her might. "Something powerful has got hold on me", she thought hazily and then...</p><p>"Ceeecile", she hissed through her lips.</p><p>"Yes my dear", he said and shook her face on last time before releasing it from his painful grip.</p><p>"You weak human, you escaped your fate last time because the 'all saviour' Xahvier was there, but this time...you won't", he leered from his eyes. Slowly his hand moved towards her throat. Shiv felt her arms somewhere and lifted them up. Feebly she touched his hand and tried to remove their grip from her throat. Cecile laughed merrily and tightened his grip, trying to crush her then and there.&nbsp;</p><p>Shiv felt suffocated, and then a crashing pain in her whole body. Her limbs thrashed the floor in protest, her body arched and writhed, her mind became hazy.......she tried to claw out his hand but he merely pushed her down and said ,"Stay. It won't take time".</p><p>Shiv felt the pain burning her whole body........she felt deprived......of breath.......... An insufferable deprivation.</p><p>And then the pain softened, somewhere her mind said ,"Finally it's over. I'm dead".</p><p>She lay there..........unmoving......silent......and peaceful.</p><p>"AAAAAAAAh", screamed someone.</p><p>"I can hear", she thought and tried to open her eyes.</p><p>"It's not possible, go away.......AAAah", she heard again.</p><p>She opened her eyes and blinked. She saw Cecile crawling on the floor, about a foot away from her, something sticky covering his right shoulder. His eyes was fixed in front of him. She looked sideways and saw the black cat purring on him. It's saber tooth covering in slime.</p><p>Suddenly the cat's attention diverted from it's victim to 'the victim'. The cat slowly moved towards her, hiding it's teeth behind it's closed mouth.&nbsp;</p><p>Shiv saw Cecile limp away.</p><p>The cat neared her. Shiv's body was completely drenched of energy. She didn't even tried to move. She only kept her eyes fixed at the cat.</p><p>When the animal was so close to her that Shiv can even smell it's sweet breath, then the cat held out it's paw and put it on her head.</p><p>Shiv fixedly looked in the cat's eye and the cat looked at her. Then the cat closed it's eyes. Mystified, Shiv closed her eyes too.</p><p><em>Several images passed her mind in a second. A buzz of colour.......and then it stopped at a scene. Shiv saw herself from the cat's eyes, sitting on the soft grass, dressed wierdly in a satin white clothe that waved unnecessarily. She saw herself smiling and stroking the cat.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Then the images started to stir again. They buzzed around and then stopped, this time at a large stone entrance. The cat was staring ahead at a large crowd of people. It turned it's head and Shiv saw herself standing at it's side. She was holding a sword in her hand and was dressed in a strange suit armor. She saw herself looking at herself...or at the cat....who was showing her this. The images stirred again............</em></p><p><em>Now she saw a large stoned hall, and she saw herself standing at the centre talking to several strange people. She saw herself nodding to them and then........................poof! It all went black.</em></p><p>She opened her eyes, and stared at the cat.</p><p>It removed it's paw from her forehead and backed a step. Then it raised it's head high and gave out an earsplitting roar.&nbsp;</p><p>A roar that could have freezed anyone to death. It howled again and sat down beside her.</p><p>Shiv closed her eyes and drifted into unconciousness................................</p></div>
