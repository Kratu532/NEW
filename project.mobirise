But it was too early, who could it be. Shiv thought as she reluctantly woke up. She threw her sheets away and opened the door. \"Oh, Professor Sawhney. Good morning sir, how come\", she asked. \"Shiv we saw it blaze dazzlingly before our eyes\", Professor Sawhney exclaimed. \"What! I missed it, how unlucky\", Shiv regretted. \"Get ready and come to the observatory fast\", ordered Professor Sawhney.</span><br></p><p>Shiv was rushing towards the observatory as fast as she could. \"How stupid it was to go to sleep when she knew it was so certain the star will explode that night\", she thought.</p><p>She pushed the door open and rushed to the computer analyst and her colleague Agastya. Punched the buttons of the computer and saw the image of a dazzling supernova. To all of us it was &nbsp;mere a big white spot on the grey background but to her it was the time of her life.</p><p>As she was marvelling over the beauty of the image, she heard the sound of the blades of a chopper whizzing past the air. It was not unusual for helicoptors to land in the Shambala Astronomical Observatory. But it was rare at this early in the morning. It's still dawn. She did not bother to look out at the sour faces of the officials, instead she was happy with her \"white blot\".</p><p>\"How could you do that, NO,please\", cried Aradhya. Shiv heard this and came out of the observation hall. What! They are arresting Professor Sawhney, why?</p><p>The police officials and the CBI officers were handcuffing the professor. Shiv instantly reached them and asked the officials about the matter. Reluctantly they said that he had commited a serious offence but what exactly 'the offence' &nbsp;was they refused to tell.</p><p>As they all were about to mount the chopper suddenly professor Sawhney stopped and turned. There was something in his eyes, as if he dreaded something very serious. Untill this time everyone was out in the garden. He turned, he was looking straight into Shiv's eyes and said,</p><p>\"WE CAN'T HOLD IT LONGER. THE TIME HAS COME THAT EVERYONE KNOWS THE TRUTH.\"</p><p>The officials hurled him inside and flew away.&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone was dead silent. No one has ever dreamed about anything like this on such an important day.</p><p>Aradhya neared Shiv, she was very afraid. She asked,\"Shiv, what was it?\"</p><p>Shiv said,\"I think I know!\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

In the hurry to tell you about the arrest of professor Sawhney I forgot to tell you about the place, people etc. So here it comes:</p><p><i>Disclaimer: This gonna be boring . Ha! just kiddin\". You need to know this to enjoy the story! ;-)</i></p><p>The <b>Shambala Astronomical Observatory</b> lies at the side of a cliff in the foot of the mountain range of Himalyas, in the state of Uttarakhand. It's presence at such height is of stratigical importance for the studies conducted there. This observatory consists of a large domed telescope along with a huge hall where all the computer and analytical works are done. There is one small room over the left of the hall, in which professor Sawhney works along with other researchers. There is also a huge room over the right of the hall, where all the documents are kept along with a computer server and other necessary equipments and lab space for reaserch work.</p><p> There is a large garden in front of the observatory with all sorts of flowers and &nbsp;several ivys climbing up to the roof of the hall. A feast for the eyes with a mesmering background of Himalayas, pure as fresh water drop.</p><p>At a distance of few yards there are the quarters for the researchers and workers to live in, as the nearest town was far away.</p><p>As for the town, it lies in the valley down the cliff. Surrounded by the mountain, it sleeps in the lap of nature in such a peace as if it were a newborn baby. The town is not very big, it has a clock tower (which is the highest building in the whole town) and several small houses and settlements.</p><p>As for the people they're five in total who work in the observatory. <b>Professor Anant Sawhney</b> is the head who lead all the reasearch work &nbsp;carried out there, he is about 60 in age and a very genial person. He is a real genius when it comes to space science. <b>Agastya</b> is the computer analyst, he is in his early twenties(22), a true computer geek and a very funny man indeed. <b>Aradhya</b> and <b>Shiv</b> are the budding reaserchers, both are of about the same age (23-24). <b>James Watson</b> is an English reasercher and works here as a temporary recruit from <b>Starstruck Space Agency</b> (a big player in space technology at present), he is about 25 in age. He is a true inthusiast in space science. There is also a housekeeper who takes care of this little group, <b>Mrs. Mufti </b>, she is a widow and is about 50 in age. Originally an inhabitant of the town down the cliff, now she lives in the house and is in command of the quarters.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Cheers! &nbsp;:-)</span></p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

They all were assembled in the lab room sitting around a table which was set in the front part of the room near the windows. Professor Sawhney's arrest was a shock for all of them. No one had ever expected that for a person like him, so genial was he and always stayed absorbed in his own bussines.</p><p>\"I can't exactly tell but from about a month he became essentric. He was not his own self. Never answered my calls and hesitated whenever I asked about his prolonged visits to the town\", droned Shiv in a manner of brooding over a thought. \"We all have noticed that Shiv, but what on earth it has to do with his arrest\", said James. \"The officials gave us no exact answers, I think we should check in his work room. Who knows what we get\", said Agastya. \"I think it's a good idea\", said Aradhya.</p><p>\"Uhm, why the hell it's not opening\", complained Agastya. \"It's jammed stupid\", said Aradhya. \"No, it's not jammed, it's locked\", said Shiv, \"I know the handle is moving, but it's not locked that way, maybe it has some kind of biometric lock\". \"So we'll never be able to open it\", said Aradhya.</p><p>\"Hey! Are you out of your mind\", exclaimed Aradhya. James was holding an axe in his hand. He stabbed the door with it and an ear piercing alarm broke out. \"What's all this security is for, jewelleries or gold or he's got the kohinoor diamond locked in there\", asked Agastya jokingly.</p><p>They all stepped inside. There was nothing amiss. \"OK let's check his laptop\", Agastya said and started to fiddle with it. \"I don't understand what Professor wanted to say. What was that 'truth' thing\", wondered Aradhya.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Here's nothing guys, it's absolutely blank, not even the documents of his research\", said Agastya. \"Which is really wierd, maybe those officials erased his documents when they came here to arrest him. Obiously they took him out from this room\" James observed.</p><p>\"I think that for now we should go back to the hall and continue our work, I hope we will be informed soon\", said Shiv.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">They all worked till the afternoon when they took a break to lunch. Even working on the image of the rare supernova did not cheer Shiv up. She felt like she was forgetting something, something very important. Then suddenly Agastya shouted,\"Guys, I've &nbsp;got a mail from the </span><b style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">ISRO</b><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">. They say that a new head of the observatory is arriving two days later i.e. on Monday\". James stood up and came to Shiv. He said,\"Isn't it strange, they are doing it all too quickly\". Now Aradhya also joined the conservation,\" Ya, last time when Professor Parth retired, it was nearly a month before Professor Sawhney joined in.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Eventually it was night, 10:00 to be exact. They closed all the work, shut down the observatory and headed back to their quarters.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Their 'home', as they call it, was really huge. It had six rooms (each with a bathroom), a big hall for dining and other purposes, a kitchen, a basement and a garden along with a backyard (Luxurious).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">They all sat dining around the table, which was in the hall along the wall beside the kitchen, the delicious food of Mrs. Mufti released some stress, when the conversation broke out. \"We should check his room\", proposed Aradhya. \"What we will get there, foul socks\", joked Agastya. \"It's worth a try, what if we get some clues ourselves before the authorities explain us the situation\", Shiv said.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">After dinner Shiv and James went in Professor Sawhney's room. Aradhya remained in the hall, processing the images of the star's explosion. Whereas Agastya went to sleep.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">As expected the room was in its place, nonetheless they searched through all the papers, books and his cupboards. When Shiv was rummaging Professor's clothes, she found his pen case. It was no ordinary pen case, it was one of the finest works of the Parker's. It &nbsp;was gifted to him by the prime minister when he made his discovery on black holes. Instinctively Shiv opened the case, but what is this, it was empty. Shiv called James,\" Look James it's empty\". \"What! What's empty. Oh this case, strange, it was his most important thing and now he is so careless with it\". Shiv opened her mouth to say but before she could say anything James again said,\"No, he didn't carry the pen with him.

But this fog cleared soon and the reality dawned on her. For few minutes she stayed in her bed motionless trying to grasp it all. How it all had changed in just a day. If it had not happened she would have been working with the Professor on her dream project. And then suddenly she remembered, as if someone has hit her head with it. That day, about a fortnight away, she was sitting in Professor's room when he asked her:</p><p><i>\"Shiv, what if one day I leave this place suddenly, what you'll think of me\". \"What Professor, why,\" she half looked at his face and it was as solid as stone, she got scared for a second but answered,\"Umm, if this happens then I'll know that you have something important at hand and that whatever you are doing has some meaning to you which we don't know but is of immense importance\". \"Will you believe that whatever I've done is for greater good, will you have faith in me?\" asked Professor again. She hesitated for a moment then answered, \"Yes, Professor I'll believe you\". And then she noticed that his face smoothed as if he is infinitely relieved.&nbsp;</i></p><p>That day the conversation had no meaning to her but today it meant a lot. It means that he had already seen his arrest. At this thought she sprang from her bed and got ready (so fast that she tripped over about two times).</p><p>\"Hey guys, I've something to tell you all,\" everyone sat around the table while Mrs. Mufti poured tea in everyone's cup, she was too very upset from the 'disappearence'. \"I remembered something\". And Shiv told them everything.</p><p>\"He knew it already\", said Aradhya. \"And maybe he is the one who cleared all the stuff from his laptop before his arrest, so that no one can access it,\" suggested James. \"What is this man hiding,\" said Agastya and stamped his fist on the table, and spilled his tea. \"What are you doing dirty boy, now I'll have to teach you how to eat,\" said Mrs. Mufti and streached his ears. For the first time they all laughed and it felt so good.&nbsp;</p><p>After breakfast they went to the observatory. \"Ah man, what we'll do of this door, James its your punishment to mend it,\" said Aradhya. \"Why, it's because of me you all entered the room .............\" and they started to argue. Shiv smiled and started to work. Their work was time consuming and tideous and hence even till noon they had not much progressed in their work of studying the supernova. All the data the telescope had collected through the night was also to be processed and hence they had no time to think about Professor or anything else.&nbsp;</p><p>It was past 2:30 when any of them thought of lunch or tea. They decided that Agastya will stay in the observatory and rest will go to lunch and bring for him too.</p><p>Mrs. Mufti was very accustomed to their lateness and hence she kept their lunch in fridge. She instantly prepared hot coffee and they all ate hungrily.</p><p>Suddenly their was a tap on the door. \"I'll check\", said Aradhya.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Shiv, they are here to seize all the possesions of Professor Sawhney\", she said in a barely audible voice. \"Who\", asked Shiv. She stood up and saw two police officers along with an official looking man.</p><p>\"Can you show us the room of Mr. Sawhney\", said the man in a heavy voice. \"But why do you want his things\", inquired James. \"No questions sir, we are only following the orders\", again said the man. James got angry but decided to remain silent. Shiv showed the way.</p><p>They ransacked the whole room but took nothing from there. The man came out from there and headed towards the observatory. They all followed him.</p><p>When he reached there with his two police officers he asked,\" Who did this?\", indicating the slaughtered door. \"We were trying to open the door but it was locked so we... Well no problem with that I suppose,\" said Shiv sternly. The man looked for a moment at her, jerked his shoulder and then&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">moved into the room. \"Phew, thanks\", said James smiling at her.</span></p><p>From here they took lots of papers, the laptop (which was useless but they didn't know), surprisingly all the small table decorations and his books. Then they came out and started to go. \"Can you tell us what's happening, first Professor and now his possessions, what you guys are up to\", asked Agastya. \"We can't answer sir, we don't have the orders\", said the man and turned away. One of the police officer looked at the group and said,\" These CBI's are a bit eccentric. When we were on the way I heard him say to someone on phone that this professor of your's has betrayed some.....\" he was cut short by the official who called him to come urgently. And they all went away.</p><p>\"Professor betrayed someone\", they all said in one tone. \"No, I trust him, he can't\", said Shiv. \"I too trust him, he was the most honest person I've ever met, but then what was that officer saying,\" said James. No one has the answer.</p><p>That night, they do not have a lot of work so they arranged the telescope for the night (it was a computerised telescope so it didn't need manual adjusting), closed the observatory and came back to their 'home'.&nbsp;</p><p>Shiv and Aradhya were sitting on the sofa disscusing their theory about the supernova they had witnessed yesterday. Agastya was working on his laptop whereas James sat writing his book on <b>\"A guide to the stars\"</b>. About an hour later Mrs. Mufti called in for dinner.</p><p>\"We'll have to clear Professor's room for the new head arriving tomorrow\", said Aradhya. \"Who's going to come?\" asked Mrs. Mufti. \"A replacement of the Professor grandma,\" said Shiv. \"I'll need your help. I'm not doing it alone\", ordered Mrs. Mufti. Shiv smiled cordially. She was thinking about the officials. Why did they took the table decorations? Well she had the pen case of the Professor. What happened to the Professor? Who's going to come tomorrow? Lots of questions and no answers.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

She, James and Mrs. Mufti were doing the job. Agastya simply refused to wake up so early,\" I do not want dark circles below my eyes\". Aradhya is a very sound sleeper so either she deliberately didn't answered the banging of the door or she really was asleep is not clear.&nbsp;</p><p>Cleaning up the room was not so boring. James packed the clothes and Shiv cleared the possesions wheras Mrs. Mufti was ascorting the packed boxes to the basement.&nbsp;</p><p>\"How's your book work going\", asked Shiv. \"Cool! Can you help me open this box?\", said James. He was holding a very antique looking box. Shiv took it and tried to open the lid but failed. \"OK, we'll not throw it. Try our luck next time,\" said Shiv and put the box on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon the work was done and it was still 6:15, so they both got ready for the breakfast earlier than the other two. \"You know Professor once told me that his pen, whose case we found yesterday, had a storage piece in it where about 1 TB data can be stored\", said Shiv. \"Are you saying that, when yesterday the officers took the table decorations with them, they were trying to find that pen or that storage device,\" said James openmouthed. \"And whatever Professor stored in it, is of immense value to them\", said Shiv gravely.</p><p>Now Agastya and Aradhya were also down and they all ate together. \"Well done guys! You've done all the cleaning\", said Aradhya. \"Thanks to my snores!\", joked Agastya. \"Ya, keep up the hard work\", mocked James. </p><p>\"What's in breakfast, grandma\", asked Shiv to Mrs. Mufti. \"Your favourite <i>parathas</i> my dear,\" said Mrs. Mufti smiling cordially.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Fhen fish tha fead forming,\" Agastya tried to say. \"Finish it first\" scolded Aradhya \"disgusting\", she mumbled. Agastya gulped and repeated, \"When is the head coming\". \"Anytime soon\", replied James.</p><p>The sky was clear as it's the beginning of July (perfect for the telescope operation). The town in the valley was as beautiful and tranquil as ever. They started to work. Shiv was working on a report on the supernova which they had to send to ISRO for inspection. There was a knock on the door.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Yes grandma, what's the matter\", enquired Shiv. \"Someone's at house, want's to meet yeh all,\" she said. \"I'll see,\" Shiv said.</p><p>Shiv followed Mrs. Mufti into the house. \"Yes,\" she frowned at the man. He was a very sombre looking person, in his early forties. His face was pale and very expressionless. He wore a black suit as that of bussinessmen and had an air of gloom about him. \"I am the replacement of Professor Sawhney, my name is Ashoka Hans\", said he in a drawling voice. \"He looks like <i>Severus Snape</i> in real life,\" Shiv thought.&nbsp;</p><p>\"You will like to see your room first, I presume Professor Hans\", said Shiv. \"You are mistaken miss, I'll like to walk into the observatory first\", he said dryly. He stood up, looked at Mrs. Mufti and said,\" Old lady will you place my things in my room\". \"Hmm\", said Mrs. Mufti and mumbled something under her breath.</p><p>Mr. Hans entered the observatory and without looking at anyone else headed straight to Professor Sawhney's room (now his). \"How rude\", said Aradhya screwing her face.&nbsp;</p><p>After few minutes he came out and said,\" I want this door made up by tomorrow, and by the way what are you all working at\". James explained everything to him. \"Do you know why Professor was arrested\", said Aradhya. \"I mind my own bussiness miss and hope you'll too\", Hans said and started inspecting the observatory.</p><p>For some time they looked at him, and then continued their work. It was tiring as they had to work on the telescope too. Again they were late for lunch. \"What would you like tea or supper,\" joked Mrs. Mufti. Shiv stayed at the observatory to work on the report. When she finished it, she stood up and started looking for Mr. Hans but didn't find him. She came out and started to head towards the backyard of their quarters. When she was at the back door, she heard a ruffling noise. She turned and saw Mr. Hans standing behind her. \"What are you doing here?\", he asked. \"Looking for you Mr. Hans\", she replied. \"Why?\", he groaned. \"The report is ready, only if you look at it once,\" she said. \"Put it in my room\", he said and moved away.</p><p>Shiv felt something mysterious about this new person.</p><p>She went to Mr. Hans' room and put the report on the bed. His luggage was not yet opened. It was not much though, seeing that he was going to stay there for a long time. His possession included a bag for clothes and a breifcase (too less and who carries breifcase now-a-days). Shiv thought it was weird. But then there was everything weird about him.</p><p>After lunch or tea (not clear) Shiv came back to the observatory and resumed her work. After adjusting the telescope, they all freed up at 9:45 (to be exact). They all sat in the hall. Mr. Hans was in his room and Mrs. Mufti cooking up the dinner. James sat beside Shiv and said,\" This man is nuts. He is so gloomy and I've got to fix that door too\". \" By the way it's carpenter who's going to fix that door, you have just called him. And yes I too think he is strange\", she said frowning at him. And she narrated the evening's event to him. By this time Agastya and Aradhya were also listening intently to her.</p><p>\"I think he was trying to hunt rabbits in those bushes\", joked Agastya. Aradhya frowned and shook her head. \"Are you going to have dinner or not?\", shouted Mrs. Mufti.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Someone call Mr. Hans\", said Mrs. Mufti when they all arranged themselves at the dining table. James went to call him.&nbsp;</p><p>They all ate together. Mr. Hans didn't utter a word during the dinner. He didn't even laugh at Agastya's jokes (which is usually a feat performed by Aradhya).&nbsp;</p><p>When finally Shiv entered her room she remembered about that box (which she found in Hans' room while clearing it up). She hurried to his room wondering whether Mr. Hans will be annoyed that she turned up to his room at such an hour.&nbsp;</p><p>Hans opened the room looking as if someone threw slime at his face. \"Yes\", he said gloomily. \"I forgot a thing of mine in this room can I have it?\", asked Shiv. \"Fast\", said Hans. She entered the room. Obiously Hans was unpacking his clothes out. It consisted of two shirts, two trousers, a coat and some casuals (again too less for such a long stay). His briefcase was standing beside his bed. She grabbed that box and hurried out.</p><p>She was wondering about the weirdness of Hans when she fell asleep. &nbsp;</p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Last year when we all were sitting in the backyard and Agastya was telling one of his made up stories, he had said to me, \"You don't know Shiv what the facts are\". &nbsp;</i><i style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"But professor how can you be so sure\". \"Because I know there is definitely something in these rumours.

I have met them personally and I have seen their truth in their eyes\". &nbsp; \"So what they say\". \"Well one of them said that they hear some rumbling noises in that <b>cave mountain</b>. The frequency of these happenings are more at the foot of &nbsp;that cave mountain.&nbsp;</i><i style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Don't look at me like that, I'm not saying anything supernatural does that, but there should be some scientific explanation for that. Mountains don't ring on themselves. I've got to find this out\". &nbsp;\"You'll see professor its just a pastime story..............</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Hey where are you lost\", Aradhya shook her. \"Err, nothing\", said Shiv. But now she was thinking that whether this incident has something to do to the mystery that hangs over them. Is there any thruth in what those shepherds say? Shiv made up her mind that she will look into the matter further. &nbsp;What if she gets some clue as to whether professor really researched this matter or finally changed his mind not to bother into these village people's stories.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">That night they had an overnight observation so Shiv and Agastya were still in the observatory while others were sleeping. For once Shiv thought that she should tell Agastya about what she was upto but then decided against it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"I don't like this Hans. He is such a \"hate me\" kind of person\", said Agastya making a disgusted face. \"Ya right. Do you really think he was searching rabbits in those bushes\", laughed Shiv. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \"Do you really think I'm mad\", smiled Agastya. \"Of course, I think\", she laughed, \"but seriously it was wierd\". \"Yes \", said Agastya and got lost in thought.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">It was about 11:00. Agastya had dozed off, his head sunk on his chest. Shiv stood up and went to the lab room, which is at the right to the hall. Earlier in the evening she had put coffee in a thermoflask on the gathering table in that room. She filled up her cup and turned towards the door.</span></p><p>Her legs stopped a few steps away from the entrance. She hid behind the door and peeped out.</p><p>Mr. Hans was standing beside Agastya and was looking sideways. Apparantly he was checking whether someone else was also there. When he was satisfied that no one except snoring Agastya was present there, then he silently tiptoed towards his office door. He locked the door behind him, atleast this is what Shiv thought.&nbsp;</p><p>\"This man's never going to come out. It's over an hour\", she thought. Untill now she had emptied two cups of coffee. Then after about five minutes she heard the creaking of the door hinges. She swiftly took her position behind the door and fixed her eyes at the entrance. Hans slowly came out of the office and locked the door with his key. Then he silently went out of the observatory.</p><p>Shiv came back to the hall and half fell on a chair. She was trying to make sense with what she had just witnessed. \"I'll tell Aradhya about this\", she mumbled under her breath. She glanced at the clock, which hung at the front wall, it was midnight. She took in a deep breath and started working on the data collected by the telescope all this while.</p><p><br></p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Startled Shiv turned her chair and what was that, James, Aradhya and Mrs. Mufti were standing there wearing birthday caps and holding balloons. (In that noise, Agastya woke up suddenly and fell out of his chair). Mrs. Mufti looked like a clown, Shiv thought and wondered how she agreed for that plan of her friends.</p><p>At the same time she was both surprised and happy. Actually she had herself forgot about her birthday in solving these ever increasing mysteries.</p><p>\"Happy birthday child, may the God grace upon you,\" blessed Mrs. Mufti. \"Ya, gimme my homework back\", yawned Agastya and stetched himself. But soon he realised what he said and wished greetings to Shiv. \"You've been sleeping\", said Aradhya looking scornfully at Agastya. Agastya made an equally scornful face at her.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Leave Aradhya, come Shiv I've something for you\", said James and he lead everyone to the lab room. There he opened a cake box on the table, lit a candle on it and let out a knife towards the birthday girl. \"How old are you now?\", asked Agastya. \"24, bit old isn't it?\", smiled Shiv.&nbsp;</p><p>She blew the candles. Everyone chorused the birthday song, merrily. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aft<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">er this little party was over, Mrs. Mufti cleared the table and went back to the quarters.&nbsp;</span></p><p>\"Where is Mr. Hans\", enquired Shiv. \"He is sleeping and I don't want him to ruin our party\", said Aradhya with a frown over her face. Shiv thought about what she had witnessed an hour ago and decided to disscuss it later in the day.</p><p>\"Now you both go and rest, we will manage here\", said Shiv. \"Have a cup of coffee and don't doze off again\", said Aradhya handing a cup off coffee to Agastya. And they both went away. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Shiv was standing outside the observatory facing the rising sun. It gleamed in her eyes and her hairs flapped against her brown face in the cool, chilly morning breeze. The town in the valley beneath looked so beautiful. The pine trees were adorned with cold pearls and it seemed that the sun rays were carressing the mist that engulfed the valley.&nbsp;</p><p>She felt very sleepy. James was heading straight to her. \"Go and have rest\", said he smiling and headed towards the observatory.</p><p>Shiv slept till late in the afternoon. She woke up at 2:00, got ready and went downstairs in the hall. \"What's in the lunch grandma\", she enquired. \"Sandwiches, child\", replied Mrs. Mufti. By the time the table was ready, Agastya was also downstairs.</p><p>\"Any news from the officials about professor Sawhney\", asked Shiv. \"Nothing\", said agastya, \"but I have hopes that soon there will be a clarification. By the way there's an order from your parents, maybe a present, it's in my room, take it when you please\".</p><p>\"Agastya I'm going to the town, will you come\", asked Shiv. \"No, I have work to do. Why are you going there?\", &nbsp;asked Agastya. \"Just for a stroll\", said Shiv. Actually she had made up her mind to talk to the people of the town about professor Sawhney. She hoped to find the reason behind his frequent visits there.</p><p>She was standing at the entrance of that small town, her face towards north. Behind her was a long winding road that lead to the city of himanchal, the hill station. At the west of the town was the cliff at which the observatory can be seen. From all the other sides, the town was surrounded with hills and mountains. At the north east from the entrance, the cave mountain was visible, about a kilometer away.&nbsp;</p><p>She walked in a small teashop and sat on a table under the shed. The evening hasn't arrived yet but the mountains shadowed the whole town and it was hard to believe that it was still 3:00. She sat in a corner and started looking around. The teashop boy put a cup of steaming hot tea in front of her and went away. She took a sip and it felt the best thing in this cold. </p><p>Suddenly her eyes fell upon a group of villagers who sat grouped around a man whose face was concieled behind a black, tattered&nbsp;<i>shawl</i>. This group was sitting beside the wall of the teashop in front of her, not far away so that she could eavesdrop. </p><p>That man was sitting huddled up and was smoking <i>hookah</i>. Behind the curtain of smoke and black <i>shawl</i>&nbsp;a harsh voice came as if lost in some dream,</p><p><i>\"I'll tell you how it happened. It was a dark and foggy december night, snow was falling steadily and the cold wind was shreaking like a dead soul. I was sleeping beside my bonfire in that cave\", </i>And he pointed towards that cave mountain, \"<i>Suddenly a voice came,a humming voice, then a thud, as if something has fallen. Then noise of some footsteps in hurry and suddenly it was all silent. I thought that I was dreaming so I slept on. But I was mistaken because about an hour later I heard those noises again. This time I was sure, so I picked up a log from my fire and headed inside the cave towards the source of the noise. I walked for about fifteen minutes but never met a soul. There was no one and still I was sure that I heard those noises. I came back to my sleeping place but what I see, all my possesions were gone, well there was nothing much, but still someone stole it\", </i>finished the man. Eveyone in the group seemed awstruck with such an incredible story.</p><p><i>\" Ya you're right\",</i> interjected one of the listners and he started reciting his own story, <i>\"You know, once I was crossing by that cave mountain. I was tierd by my journey so I decided to sit inside it for some time. As I was munching my snacks I heard some people talking. So I stopped chewing to listen their talk. And you know they were talking in a very strange language. I was not able to make out a single word as their voices were quite low. So I decided that I should go and meet these people and when I reached the place there was no one. I was so terrified that I ran straight away from there,\" </i>finished that villager with a triumphed smile, looking at the intruiged faces of the others. All the other villagers started murmuring in consent that the cave mountain is really haunted. Some others also mentioned that they hear strange noises in night from that cave mountain.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">After some time the crowd dispersed and that man started walking away, he slightly limped as he walked. Shiv instantly slammed the bill money on table and started following him. That man went into the pine trees behind the tea shop. Shiv waited untill they both were well out of sight and then called him from behind to stop. He turned towards her and took off the <i>shawl </i>from his face. That man looked completely like a beggar and was surely a vagabond.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"I want to ask you some thing\", she said.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"It's that cave mountain right\", said he in a droning voice. \"Yes and no, did you ever tell this story to anyone from the cliff over yonder\", she pointed. \"Hmm, once an old person had asked me. He was very desparate about it and even asked me to accompany him to that place. But why are you asking about it?\" &nbsp;\"Can you take me there?\" &nbsp;\"Hmm\".</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">He took her towards the mountain amidst that pine forest. The branches bruished her arm at places, but these attacks were unaffected on the limbs of that man who would have been suffering them for years. Even though he was limped but he faced no difficulty in walking over the uneven paths of the forest. The evening was getting in closer and the mist started spreading itself over the whole town. The forest appeared more ghastly with trees like sentinals standing on gaurd. Birds were croaking rather than chirping.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"It feels like an hour\", thought Shiv. But soon the trees started lessen and they came at the edge of the pine forest. The cave was visible at the foot of a rather short mountain (but still it was huge). The mouth of the cave was very large. Large stalactites hanged from the ceiling of the cave. And it's walls were covered with moss. Huge boulders of rocks were littered over the whole cave.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">It was getting darker so Shiv decided to return. \"I've seen the place so I'll come back here later\", She thought. \"Ok, so is there any way other than the forest to return to village\", she asked. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He took her back to the town through a dirt track. On reaching the town she asked him, \"Where can I meet you if I ever needed you again\". \"At the edge of that forest behind the tea shop, I have a small hut of mine\", he replied dryly and went away.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Shiv returned to the house. \"Where were you so late?\", asked Agastya, he was sitting near the window working on his computer. \"I had wandered off the town, so it took me a while to find the way back\", she replied and rushed towards her room (which was on the first floor). \"I've put your parcel in your room\", shouted Agastya from behind.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">It was a big parcel box, so Shiv hoped for a good present. There were gifts from her other friends piled at her bed. She smiled smugly. \"I'll have to change my clothers, the sleeves are scratched badly. It was mere luck that Agastya was sitting in the dark and Mrs. Mufti was not around otherwise it would have been a hard job explaining\", murmured Shiv under her breath.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">She swiftly changed and jumped at her bed to open her presents. Her parents had sent her a beautiful&nbsp;<i>saree</i>&nbsp;to wear with a small birthday card. \"Blue as always\", she thought. Agastya and Aradhya had gifted her jointly (which was a surprise as they are never at good terms) a book by Agatha Christie. James had gifted her a bracelet with her initials carved on it. \"How pretty\",she exclaimed and put it on her wrist. Mrs. Mufti had presented her a small flute (this really confused her as she didn't knew how to play one). And obiously nothing from Mr. Hans. She really missed professor Sawhney's present.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">She lay reading her new present untill called for dinner.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Thank you all for your presents. I was really overwhelmed with joy. By the way, what is the flute for grandma\", she asked. \"For you to learn to play it\", replied Mrs. Mufti laughing. \"What you guys been doing all day\", asked James and glanced at his present. \"Workin' on that data you gave me to analyse, forgot\", said Agastya. \"I've visited the town\", said Shiv and thought, \"I'll tell them about my true purpose only when I get some clue or they will think I've lost my mind in believing these folklores\".</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Somehow I'll have to sneak time tommorow to visit that cave\", she thought. And slowly drifted away to sleep. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Suddenly she bumped her leg in the sidetable beside her bed. \"Ouch, aah\", she started jumping on one leg holding the other in her hand. Only then she noticed that a box had fallen on the floor.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Aah, I had completely forgotten about it,\" and she sat down on her bed, still rubbing her leg. She tried with all her might to open that box but it's lid won't budge. \"I think I'll have to cut it, but it'll be a pity to cut such a pretty box,\" so she put that box on the table and hid her face behind her papers.</p><p>\"Shiv, will you go to town today\", shouted Mrs. Mufti from behind the door. She sat erect in her bed. \"What?\", she asked astonished. Mrs. Mufti entered her room. She was holding the laundry basket in her hands. \"Our goods supplier is out of town and I needed monthly rations and no one's free to go. They all refused to leave the observatory, so will you go\", said Mrs. Mufti in one breath. \"OK\", replied Shiv.</p><p>\"Now, I won't have to lie to anyone\", she murmured happily.</p><p>It was noon and Shiv had hurridly summed up her day's work, others were very confused that why she was so excited to bring rations. </p><p>She was in her room and was packing up some trifles like a magnifying glass, a torch, a notebook and a pen, some snacks (mystery solving is very tedious), and her smart phone (very important). \"Sherlock Holmes always helps, am I forgetting something, No\", she said to herself.</p><p>\"Yes grandma where's the list\", she said. \"What is this backpack for\", said Mrs. Mufti staring at her bag. \"Nothing, gimme the list, hurry\". She put the list and money in her bag and rushed out.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"I'll have to search that cave swiftly, I don't have much time\". She was walking through the woods so that no one could see her going towards that cave. In less than fifteen minutes she reached the cave.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">There was no one around the cave, at least that is what she saw. So she hurridly put her things down, and took out her torch as it was dark inside the cave and started examining the cave.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">The stalactites were a magnificient piece of limestone work. The nature had spent years on nurturing them which can be seen in the intricate patterns carved on them. But they were like any other stalactites and had nothing peculiar about them. So she drifted her attention towards the walls where she hoped to find any electronic device which could explain the strange noises heard at that place. She was pretty sure that someone must be joking with the poor villagers.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">It took more time to examine them than she had previously thought. She was looking at the moss on the cave walls with her torch when she noticed that in that moss covered wall there was a clean rectangular patch on the stone covered with dust, not much in size but it was perfectly rectangular. She wiped away the dust and saw that some strange symbols were carved on the surface of the rock. She briskly went to her bag, took out her notebook and pen and drew those symbols. \"These symbols must be of some ancient language or I don't know but they surely mean something\", she mumbled under her breath.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Clank\", there was a sudden, sharp noise of falling down as of metal on the floor. Shiv stood rooted at her spot, looking blankly in the dark, her heart was thumping so loudly that she could hear her heartbeat. Definitely she was alone, but then this noise. She took up her torch, holding it firmly in her hand she slowly moved towards the place from where she thought the noise came. When she reached there she saw nothing which could have caused that clanking noise. There only was a wall in front of her. She started examining it, by now she was completely drenched in sweat, though the temperature was pretty low.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">In this wall too she saw a perfect rectangular spot in the centre and when she cleared away the dust she saw those strange symbols engraved on it. She noted down these too in her notebook. After sometime she was completely convinced that no other clue could be found there so it was time to return. She started packing her bag, checking that nothing was left behind except footmarks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">She was feeling very hot (even in this cold hilly atmosphere) and was very tired so she sat down, took out her water bottle and gulped down the cold water. She was looking out of the cave towards the mountains, visible above the pine forest. She sat marvelling over them when she thought she heard something, some strange voice, no not a single voice it's voices, some people are talking but she can't make out the words. What is this language? It sounded like a whisper of some people not far away. But she was....... alone here.......&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Next time I'll bring my friends and some weapons too, this is a very wierd bussiness\", she panted as she hastily returned to the village.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">After taking all the supplies from the town she headed towards the observatory, as the distance was not much so they usually walked the length. In the way back, she thought, \"It was so stupid of me to run away like this but it is terrifying when you are alone in that creepy cave\".</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">She was back untill the tea-time and everyone was assembled in the hall. Mr. Hans was nowhere to be seen and Mrs. Mufti was busy in the house chores so it was perfect time to reveal the truth of her expeditions, Shiv thought.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">She sat on the sofa holding a sandwitch in her hand. Everyone was grouped around her like children around grandma when she narrates them a bedtime story, Agastya and Aradhya were sitting on the sofa in front of her, James was sitting beside her sipping tea. \"You'll think I'm mad or something but whatever I'm going to tell you is completely true\". And she told them about whatever happened since she first thought to gather clues about professor's expeditions to the town to when she first met that group of people beside the teashop and about what happened today. \"Don't look at me like that I'm not an alien\", she said to Agastya showing them the symbols which she found on the cave walls.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Hmph, so from next time I'll be with you whenever you'll go there again\", said James looking concerned. \"Why don't you told us about it before\", asked Aradhya. \"I wanted to be sure that I'm not working on a folklore and it's really worth our time, and now I have enough proof\".&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"When are you planning to visit that place again\", asked Agastya. \"Whenever you all are ready\", Shiv replied.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> \"I've been solving a mystery too\", said Aradhya, \"you remember Shiv, you mentioned once that you saw Hans lurking in the backyard behind the bushes, so I thought to follow him and figure out what he does there and I found that he goes there to smoke\". \"Hmm so that one's solved but we still don't know why he visits his office at midnights when no one's around\", said James looking serious. \"I feel like we all are detectives rather than scientists\", said Agastya.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"What about these symbols, what do they mean?\", said Aradhya. \"They could be cave paintings\", replied Shiv. \" They're not cave paintings. They are ancient mythology symbols\", said Agastya. \"And what that means\", asked Aradhya. \"Something exciting\", replied Agastya.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Lets get back to work\", said James. \"Agastya any news from the officials about professor Sawhney\", asked Shiv. \"No, nothing\", he replied.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">It was a full moon night and the moonlight entering from the windows soflty glimmered on the floor. Everything was silent and peaceful. Shiv woke up with a start, it was a very bad dream, she still can see the astoroid hurtling towards Earth.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"I feel very thirsty. What time is it,\" she glanced at the bedside clock. It was about three in the morning.</span></p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

She took out her laptop and started fiddling.&nbsp;</p><p>It's been about twenty minutes and by now she was wide awake, when she thought she heard something. It sounded like someone stepped by her door. She silently went out of her bed and moved towards the door. Quitely she peeped outside. It was Hans. She was sure she could identify his tall, erect figure even in pitch black. Now the hall was shining with moonlight and he was walking to and fro in the hall. \"He is searching something\", Shiv thought.&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly he stopped and moved towards the long hall windows. He stood there looking outside. Shiv came out of her room and slowly moved towards left in the corridor. From there she could see what was Hans looking at. She stopped dead, someone was coming towards the house. That man came to Hans and they started talking. She couldn't hear anything. \"Who is this man and why are they meeting at three in the morning\", she thought. </p><p>That man took out something from his pocket and handed it to Hans and then went away. Hans also turned back. Shiv swiftly ran into her room and silently closed the door. After a few seconds she again heard footsteps passing. &nbsp;</p><p>\"Are you sure it was him\", asked James. \"Hmm, pretty sure\", replied Shiv. They were in the observatory. All huddled up together to listen Shiv's story. \"Mark my words, he will turn out to be a ghost some day, that's why he roams in the house at nights \", remarked Agastya. Everyone stared at him. \"What?\" he said.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Be serious, you said he was searching something\", said Aradhya. \"Yes, so it seemed.\",Shiv said, \"And I'm wondering what that man gave him.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">At that moment Hans entered, he didn't gave so much as a glance to them and went straight to his office, shutting the door behind him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"It could be that Hans meets this man often, I mean in the backyard, he doesn't go only to smoke.... maybe to meet this man\", suggested Aradhya. \" Yes it could be,\" said James, \"but why?\"</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">It was about four in the evening. Sky was clear and sunshine was entering in the observatory. Agastya and Aradhya were at the house for lunch. Hans was in his office. Shiv was brooding over some papers of recent research and James was busy with the telescope. He was adjusting some equipments and was humming a tune. Classics were his favourite, he once told Shiv. This reminded her of Professor Sawhney. \"I like old hindi songs\", Professor had told, his face brightening at a sudden pleasure,\"Old melodies....\".</span></p><p>\"Bzzz...Bzzzz\", James' phone started vibrating. \"Look who's it, Shiv\", said James over his shoulder. \"Hmm\", Shiv said, \"Hello\".</p><p>\"Jaaamess\", said the voice.</p><p>\"No, Shiv here\", she corrected.</p><p>\"SHIV, it's me Sawhney\", said the voice.&nbsp;</p><p>\"PROFESSOR, how are you.. where are....\", stuttered Shiv. Until now James had come over to her.</p><p>\"Lis..ten to me\", Professor cut in,\"I can't.. tell you where I am.. , but don't worry I'm safe. I want you to do something for me.....\"</p><p>\"Yes Professor\"</p><p>\"Find that pen... you get it, THAT pen. Find it before they get it. I'll have to go.....they are following me........\"</p><p>\"Are you all right Professor?\"</p><p>\"I don't know, at least not untill you find it.....and yes don't try to contact me.... I'll contact you....\"</p><p>\"Pro..., it's disconnected\", said Shiv. She felt a lump in her throat, her eyes wet.&nbsp;</p><p>James put a hand on her shoulder and said,\" Is he all right?\"</p><p>\"He said so. He said to find that pen\", Shiv said. \"Maybe because of that storage device in it\", mumbled James. \"Hmm, he referred to some 'they' who were following him.... He is in danger.\"</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"What could be in that pen?\", asked Agastya. \"Something that could put Professor's life in danger\", said Aradhya \"something for which he can put his life in danger.......we'll have to find it.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"But we have already searched his room and his office, where else we look\", said Agastya.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Those are the places where everyone will search, remember those officials, if Professor is sure that when they searched, they didn't get it then definitely he didn't hide it there. Let's search the house.\" suggested Aradhya.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Are you talking about this pen\", said Hans. He was standing in front of them holding the pen in his ourstretched hand and smiling curtly.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"What was this supposed to mean\", thought Shiv. Should she be afraid that Hans got that pen and whatever it enshroudes before them or should she be delighted that it is better that he got it rather than those people whom Professor feared. Before she could make up her mind Hans spoke again ,\"I overheard what you were talking, so finally Sawhney called you all even after my prohibition\".</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"What! Why will you restrict him from doing anything? What have you got to do with all this?\", asked James rather puzzled by the turn of the situation.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Listen young man, Sawhney is my best friend and whatever concerns him concerns me as well\", said Hans with an offended expression. \"I think that I should explain myself\", he added.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"You better!\", said Agastya.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Without paying any attention to Agastya's rather seething remark, Hans started with his story, &nbsp; \"On the evening of June 30, I got an email from the ISRO about my transfer, here in Shambala, which puzzled me a lot because Sawhney was already here. I thought that maybe he left for some personal reasons. Actually we weren't in contact for someti...\"</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"You weren't informed that he got arrested\", cut in Aradhya.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"No, and don't interupt,\" said Hans making a face ,\"I had only three days to report here so I set out at once. When I reached here you asked me about his arrest which put me off guard, because whatever I expected I never expected this,\" he paused here to think something and then continued ,\"Later I tried to call the authorities for further information but they replied vaguely saying about some confidential information and all that. Frustated, I left the attempt and went in the backyard for some fresh air, I had strolled some way in the forest when I saw him coming, Sawhney I mean.\" here he stopped enjoying the look on their faces as they all looked at him openmouthed, stunned. He really was a man who enjoyed surprising people. After about a minute he started again rather sadly ,\"I was sorry to see him in that haggard state. He almost ran to me and said ,' I know you want to ask me a lot of questions but I don't have time. I have to find something very important.' Then he told me that he escaped from the officials with some outside help. I told him, in that case he shouldn't be seen anywhere near Shambala. Then finally he told me to find this pen and keep it until he gets a chance to get hold of it and I sent him to a cottage of my friend, which is nearby, to hide.\"&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"You knew about him all this time and you didn't bother to tell us!\", said Aradhya angrily.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"It was him who told me not to 'bother myself' by telling you all this. He said it is quite dangerous but now that he called you himself, I see no objection on his part in telling you after all.\" he stopped watching intently at their faces then continued ,\"Well, he called me later in the night and told me that this pen had a storage device in which he had got something very important. He also felt that all contact mediums to the observatory were under surveillance from after his dissapearance so he said that he will send Ram, the caretaker of the cottage, with letters for further contact. After that I set out to search, carefully keeping check that none of you suspect anything. The other night I went to his office to search there. Initially I thought that no one was there expect Agastya who was deepily in sleep when later I got to know that Shiv was keeping a watch at me,\" he smiled at her, visibily amused that he knew her secret ,\"but for days I got nothing when tonight Ram again came with a letter.\" he showed them that letter.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">It ran thus:</span></p><p><i>A.H., I think you should search the basement again. It had to be there, maybe Mrs. M. would have kept my things there. Yes, look in the wooden trunk thorougly again. Tommorow meet me in the forest at three .

Shiv was sitting on a stone far away from where the others were standing. Hans was moving to and fro through the trees, an impatient gesture on his part. He was looking at his watch every minute. Agastya, Aradhya and James were talking slowly. There senses alert for any small noise in the rustling of leaves and brushing of the wind on tree barks. James' eyes constantly flickered in her direction. A big frown creased his forehead. Aradhya was wondering ,\"She hasn't uttered a word since then. What could be the matter?\". Agastya was thinking,\"This is a very dark business.\"</p><p>\"Professor's life is in danger. I'll have to help him. He has always been a father to me, a teacher, but this is solely my decision. I can't put my friends in danger, no, I can't expect them to..\", Shiv was stuggling in her mind. \"Yes, I'll ask them to leave. Aradhya is my best friend if something happens to her, noooo....\". She put her head in her hands. Aradhya came and sat beside her and smiled. Shiv raised her head to look and gave a faint smile in response.</p><p>Five minutes later they heard footsteps. Everyone stood up, they strained their eyes to see amidst the trees. Instinctively Shiv shot her head in the direction of sound and made out the outline of three people walking towards them.&nbsp;</p><p>In a few swift strides they came out in the small clearing where the others stood. Professor Sawhney was standing in front while the others were behind him. In an out of situation expression, Professor was looking quite composed and he even smiled at them. He said,\" I've to show you all something. Follow me!\" Saying this he turned and started walking towards the east, much deeper in the forest.&nbsp;</p><p>Shiv looked at Aradhya who shrugged her shoulders and said,\" I don't know. We'll see.\" She started walking. Agastya and Hans were already keeping pace with the others. Shiv started moving towards them when James caught up with her. \"Did you see those men! How oddly they are dressed.\" he said assessing her expression. \"No. I was not paying any attention to them. Professor looks quite at ease though.\". \"Hmm, but look at them!\", he said pointing towards those men with his chin and added,\"Who wears cloaks these days. Quite Merlin sort of thing. As if any moment they would jump around and curse us all with their magic wands.\" Shiv, who was looking at those men, smiled widely. James' forhead smoothed out.</p><p>They walked silently. Shiv was looking at those men intently. \"They are walking strangely as if they are gliding in the air.\" she thought ,\"and they are quite tall too. Cloaks... huh strange!\" At that moment one of the men looked behind. His face was in the shadow. \"This man gives me creeps!\", murmured Aradhya glancing behind.</p><p>After few minutes Professor's voice sounded,\" We've reached!\"</p><p>Shiv lifted her head to look. A cold breeze went across her face and she shivered.</p><p>They were standing in front of the cave mountain. Professor gestured with his hands to come inside. \"But Professor, why, what's here?\", said Agastya. \"Just come over and see for yourself!\", he shouted from inside the cave.</p><p>They moved inside. There, in front of the back wall, those cloaked men were standing. One of them lifted his hand and put the tip of his index finger at the wall. Shiv gasped, she recognised the spot. It was the rectangular patch on the stone which she had found. That man pressed his finger. Suddenly a symbol illuminated with white light and the wall disappeared. A dark room came into existence.</p><p>Professor chuckled at their gaping mouths and stepped inside. As he set his foot on the ground, the room lightened. \"What the hell!\" exhaled Agastya. &nbsp;</p><p>A bright room materialised in front of them. White metal panelled walls, with no furniture, just a door, in front of them. The two men remained behind and Professor went ahead. As he reached closer, the door opened automatically. They all entered into a big hall. It was carved out of stone and was dimly lit. The door behind them closed and they were all plunged into semi darkness.</p><p>A tall figure was standing in front of them. He turned and looked them full in eyes. The hood of his cloak was down and they could see his ash white face with dark piercing blue eyes. He had a long bony face and black hairs. He slowly neared them. Again Shiv noticed that rather than walking he seemed to be gliding in air.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"These are the comrades of Zahvier\" said the man in a dry voice, looking at Aradhya who was in front. His lips twisted in a sneer when he whispered \"Humans!\" under his breath. \"Cecile!\", he started in a little higher tone. Shiv turned to look at Professor, who was smilling hugely. He turned his eyes to look at her and in a blink his face changed into another person. Now an ashen white man with dark blue eyes, black hair and sturdy built was facing them in Professor's clothes. He was shorter than the others like him. Shiv uttered a cry which was rather subdued in other's more vocal remarks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Keeping his gaze fixed at her face, Cecile said ,\"Yes master!\". His lips was twisted in a smirk. \"Master, Zahvier was going to meet them today. I lured them here, he will follow.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Sometimes you surprise me Cecile. I thought you just have good looks and no brain.\" This troubled Cecile a bit because his smile faded and he turned to face his master with pleading eyes. The other man continued without paying any attention to Cecile's reaction,\" When he comes, bring him to me and kill the spares.\" Saying this he turned towards the far corner of the hall and stood at a raised platform. He gave them a final look and the next second he vanished into thin air.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Shiv blinked her eyes. What was happening? Was it a dream? She turned to look at James who was staring at the wall, incomprehension was the only feature on his face. Aradhya staggered a few steps to look at Agastya who was utterly shocked. Hans was terrified. His eyes locked at Cecile's leering face.</span></p><p>Cecile turned to the two men who were standing at the back of the hall near the door. There hoods were down and they also had black hair, blue eyes and white skin. They both were burly and heavy. \"Go, keep watch\", shouted Cecile. They both complied.</p><p>Suddenly a loud noise, accompanied by an explosion blasted the door away. Smoke filled the hall. Shiv tried to look in the smoke, her heart racing. \"Zahvier!\" groaned Cecile.&nbsp;</p><p>Someone ran out of smoke and shouted ,\"DOWN!\".</p><p>\"Professor\", Shiv gasped.</p><p>Professor looked at her for the briefest second, concern gleaming in his black eyes. He said, \"Leil, you get them, I'll see Cecile.\"</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">The other girl who had entered with professor, Leilani, singlehandedly charged on the two men. She was nimble and swift, it gave those heavy men a hard time, they struggled to keep up with her as she kicked them down. With a final shoot of laser from a device on her hand, she finished them off.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Professor and Cecile ran towards each other shooting lasers and ducking at the same moment. \"You won't get me this time!\", spat Cecile. \"We'll see!\" said Professor. They charged at each other with almost animal ferocity.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Shiv pulled Aradhya towards the corner where James and Agastya were busy ducking the lasers that came in their direction. \"What a day! Shooting lasers, the only thing left to see after people changing faces and invisible doors.

She had moved a few steps when she suddenly returned to Hans' body. She started shuffling in his pockets.</p><p>\"What's it?\" asked James. \"This pen!\", she replied as she took it out from his trouser pocket.</p><p>She and James came out in the sunlight. Her eyes tried to adjust in the blinding morning light. &nbsp;</p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Her arm had a deep laser burn but she can't feel the pain, she even can't breathe, her legs locked in position. Her body erect, she stood gaping, her mind ringing of the question, \"Am I dreaming?\"</p><p>In the small clearing in front of the cave mountain, a small spacecraft was landed. By no standards it was a normal aircraft she had ever seen. It was long, its wings folded with a glass frame for the cockpit from where Leilani was beaming at her. She was amused at her expression or ignorance wasn't clear. She gestured to come in fast.</p><p>James, who was in better senses, felt that Shiv's wound needs treatment. He took her right arm and half dragged her inside by the side door. As they entered, the door jammed itself. Shiv blinked her eyes, as if that would bring any sense to what was happening.</p><p>&nbsp;\"Everyone sit down, I'm taking off!\", ordered Leilani.</p><p>Fire jets purred and the spacecraft came to life. It slowly lifted off the ground and unfurled it's wings. In a whoosh they were off. With a blinding speed they raced to sky as it changed from blue to black. The stars raced back so fast that they seemed to stretch in line.&nbsp;</p><p>A few seconds later Leilani put the craft in autopilot and turned around in her chair. Her expression tense.</p><p>Professor handed a first aid to Aradhya and went to sit at the co pilot chair. He looked out of the window.</p><p>Aradhya attended to Shiv's wound who punctuated the silence with \"AAh\"s and \"OOh\"s.</p><p>Agastya was impatiently drumming his fingers on his knee. He opened his mouth now and then but closed without saying anything.</p><p>James' eyes were fixed at Professor's back. \"You are Zahvier, isn't it Professor?\", he broke the silence.&nbsp;</p><p>Professor turned his chair. He looked at Leilani, who nodded at his unspoken question, and then looked into Shiv's eyes.</p><p>\"I'm sorry I put you all in danger. You shouldn't be here......you don't even know how many rules I am breaking at the moment\", said Professor in a broken voice.</p><p>\"Then break one more and tell us what's happening\", said Agastya in an exasperated tone, utterly frustated with the suspense.</p><p>Professor took a deep sigh and began ,\"Yes, I am Zahvier!\" he paused a moment and then continued ,\"Those damned Corvians!..... Cecile is a shrewd man, even among the Corvians, he is the best impersonator.\"</p><p>\"What's Corvians?\", asked Agastya raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\"Oh, Corvians are those who live at Corvi, the planet in...\", &nbsp;\"Corvus constillation, right?\", interjected Aradhya.&nbsp;</p><p>\"You mean ALIENS!\", shouted Agastya.</p><p>\"Yes!\", said Professor smiling a bit ,\"Corvians have power to impersonate anyone. I should have been more careful. I never imagined that you all will get involved in this bussiness. I presume Hans have told you about our meeting.\"</p><p>\"Yes, after the call....but why you called us Professor when Hans was already finding that pen for you?\", asked Shiv.</p><p>\"Because Cecile found me out at the cottage. I had to make a hasty run and I wanted that pen at any cost. I thought it better to inform you about it so that later I can have it. But things went wrong....badly wrong.</p><p>\"After getting away from Cecile, I called Leil to help. At night when I went to our meeting place, Hans wasn't there, so I went to the observatory. Mrs. Mufti informed me that you all went out with Hans somewhere. This meant danger.</p><p>\"We tracked your scent..\" &nbsp;</p><p>\"What? How? With dogs\", interupted Agastya.</p><p>\"Normans don't need dogs to track scent\", Leilani smiled (Agastya went red in face) ,\"We Normans are very good hunters\", her eyes twinkled.</p><p>\"And your scent took me to that mountain\", restarted Professor ,\"Apeirog never leaves traces of his contact with humans. It's against the Council to make direct contact with the species that is not exposed to intergalactic community. Humans are unaware of our existance, they don't know that nine intelligent civilizations inhabit the cosmos along with numerous child civilizations like themselves. </p><p>\"Apeirog is a higher member of the Council and if it is disclosed that he made direct contacts with humans then that could be disastrous to him. He always kills them who meets him and you were also destined to that fate.&nbsp;</p><p>\"By the way, you aren't safe at the moment. He would send his men for you soon. That's why I'm taking you to Norma, there you'll be guarded until Council takes Apeirog down.\"</p><p>\"And how our absence will be explained at Shambala?\", asked James.</p><p>\"I don't know! At the moment your safety is more important. This is the least I can do after what I have done to your lives. I'm sorry.\", said Professor with a sad face.</p><p>\"Don't be Professor. It was us who decided to meet you there\", said Aradhya in a consoling tone.</p><p>\"It was fate, Aradhya.... Professor does the government knows about it. I mean when you were arrested....\", said Shiv.</p><p>\"No, they were Corvians. They wanted that pen.\", answered Professor.</p><p>\"What that pen contains that it is so important for everyone?\", asked James.</p><p>\"Aah, just some information of the Council. My father, a member of the Council, gave me that to keep safe. It is important and Apeirog wants it.\", summarised Professor rather hastily.</p><p>He looked at Leilani and gave her a little nod. She stared at him for some time and then said ,\"We will reach Norma in an hour. You all can go and rest in the upper compartment.\"</p><p>They climbed up the metal rod stairs which led to upper room. It was a bit more spacious than downstairs. It had a bed by the right wall and a rugged couch on the left wall. There was a small cupboard in the back wall.&nbsp;</p><p>Shiv lied down on the bed and closed her eyes. She needed time to intake what they had come to know.</p><p>James sat on the couch where Agastya was lying. Aradhya sat at the bed beside Shiv.</p><p>\"We're going to visit a planet that's out of our solar system! It's an astrophysicist's dream come true!\", said Shiv smiling at the others.</p><p>\"Yeah! And that's other thing that we are pursued by an intergalactic murderer. First humans for that too!\", said James smiling back.</p><p>\"Don't spoil the fun Jamiee, we're among aliens, even Professor is an alien, now imagine that!\", exclaimed Agastya.</p><p>\"Do you think we'll have to keep all this secret as per that so called 'Council's' rules? In that case we'll have to come up with a really good story.\" said Aradhya.</p><p>\"Hmm. By the way, did anyone saw Agastya when Leil smiled at him. He was a tomato.\" giggled Shiv.</p><p>\"No I wasn't. You're lying\", said Agastya blushing again.</p><p>\"Is she? I also saw that\", said James poking him with a fist.</p><p>Aradhya laughed.</p><p>Meanwhile downstairs....</p><p>\"Papa, do you think Council can ever get Apeirog, he had been evading them for so long. What with all that contact with the Council members and his little force, I don't think we can ever leave them ungaurded.\" said Leilani.</p><p>Professor scowled. \"You're right Leil, that's why I'm taking them to Norma. Father will show us the way.\"</p><p>\"You didn't even tell them the truth about that pen.\"</p><p>\"They needn't know about that. We have to ensure a way out of this for them not to permanently involve them in this war.\"</p><p>\"I don't think we can do anything to avoid thier involvement. All these years we have been hiding from humans and suddenly out of nowhere these people land in our spaceship heading towards Norma. Even now can anyone refute that they aren't destined for this fate.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Professor didn't say anything. He took a deep sigh and shook his head.</p><p>\"We've reached! Everyone come down.\" shouted Leilani.</p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

We're not going to a desert. We'll be fine. Our train is on schedule and we need to get ready.\" said Chaitra and asked Daaruk to follow. The train at the Coorg station reached and they got up.</p><p>Chaitra Arya was a young archaeologist. She was a tall lady with deep black eyes and shiny black hairs. As comfort always pleased her so she was clad in a half sleeved granny dress.</p><p>When inside the train, she called her friend cum colleague Daaruk Sage and inquired him about a diary that she always carries with her.</p><p>Daaruk, a young and fair gentleman sort of man with deep eyes and tall figure came fore and assured her that all the necessaries were already packed.</p><p>\"We've all our shovels, trowels and sieves well arranged and packed, so you don't frantic\", said Daaruk and settled himself in the seat opposite her. Chaitra also sat down and waved at her mother from the train window untill she was well out of sight.</p><p>She sat glacing out of the window at the sprinting trees and hills of Sringeri as cold wind battered against her face. Sringeri was a beautiful small city full of vegetation and hills and deers in the state of Karnataka.</p><p>The cool wind was playing with her hairs, tossing them here and there over her face, when she sat reminiscing the history of Sringeri, the place which is called 'the marvel of ancient history'. Here Adiguru Shankaracharya used to lecture his disciples.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a long fabled folklore that once Shankaracharya was passing by the Tunga river when he saw a black cobra who,with a raised hood, was providing shelter, from hot sun, to a frog undergoing labour. Impressed with the divinity of the place where natural enemies had gone against their instincts to help each other, he stayed there for about twelve years.&nbsp;</p><p>She took a deep breath of fresh air and wondered about the greenry of the place, such a hypnotic invitation to all those who were tired of the mechanical urban culture. When suddenly her thoughts were interrupeted by Daaruk's circumspectious question, \"Why did they called us?\"</p><p>\"I think it must be a grave issue. Nevertheless, we will know, after this lethally long journey of thirty three hours to Mussoorie,\" said Chaitra smiling wryly.</p><p>\"By the way, Daaruk\", she continued ,\"I've come across some newspaper articles. One said 'The mystery dug out at Mongs hill, Mussoorie government on the way to hide it'. \"</p><p>\"Now the matter is in our hands so lets see what is it.\" replied Daaruk with some excitement.</p><p>On reaching to Sarai Rohilla, which was tremendously surrounded by vast and huge mountains, Daaruk informed Chaitra about the security initiative adopted for them at the destined spot under the supervision of the talented and effacious officer Ahan Sardesai. He told her that Ahan was also coming to pick them up at the Mussoorie station.</p><p>\"It's rather strange, all these security measures, isn't it?\" said Chaitra rather vaguely. \"Hmm\", replied Daaruk.</p><p>It was the evening of 4th October,1979. The train halted at the Mussoorie station. As they came out at the platform they saw a tall man standing in front of them accompanied by a middle aged woman with swaggering eyes.</p><p>\"Welcome!\", said the man in a&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">deep voice, \"I'm Ahan Sardesai, the security incharge here and this is Mrs. Daksha Mani.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">They followed them out of the station to a cab that was waiting outside and began their journey to Savoy Hotel.</span></p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

It was made of black stone with high arched ceiling. The hall was mostly empty, only a large stone throne stood erect on a platform facing the entrance. The hall contained numerous large windows that spanned the whole length of the wall, on left and front wall. The right wall was decorated with large portraits of pale skinned men who had piercing blue eyes and large bony faces. Their cold eyes stared tirelessly out of the windows and their lips were curved in the same sneer that curved the perfect features of Apeirog.</p><p>He was looking out of a window at the cold, snow covered terrain that expanded beyond the horizon, apparently lost in deep thought.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Why are you alone Cecile?\", said Apeirog and turned to face Cecile who cowed under his murderous glare. \"Mmmaster\", stuttered Cecile ,\"Zahvier came equipped. He had his daughter with him. I barely survived.\"</p><p>\"Are you sure you will breath another moment in front of me after you failed this trifle task\", said Apeirog in a steel voice.</p><p>\"Mmaster I..I... , give me a second chance. This time...\"</p><p>\"This time you won't fail. Is that what you want to say?\", said Apeirog, \"You can't even imagine with your small brain what will happen if the Council gets to know about this. All these years of work....my position in the Council....everything will be ruined.\"</p><p>He stared at the portraits of his ancestors who held the position as the members of the esteemed Council. Apeirog has always dreamed of this, his whole life. He wanted to feel that power himself, being an advisor was not enough for him.</p><p>He eyes habitually trailed towards the portrait that seemed to be the most untattered. His whole body shook in disgust at the face of his father's image which reminded him again why, even after so many accomplishes, he can't be the member of the Council.</p><p>Full of anger he strided towards Cecile, his cloak swaying behind him like a shadow, and lifted him by throat in the air. \"Kill them or kill yourself! But don't return here failed\", he hissed between his sharp white teeth.&nbsp;</p><p>He loosened his grip and Cecile disappeared in air leaving a cough echoing behind him.</p><p>At that instant footsteps sounded in the hall and Apeirog turned to meet the visitor.</p><p>\"Damion!\", he said. His features relaxed a bit.</p><p>A young, paper white man entered the hall. He was clad in the same black cloak that seemed to be the staple of Corvians. His long, black hairs fell over his shoulders and his blue eyes shined as his gaze met with that of Apeirog's.</p><p>\"Father\", he said in a smooth icy voice ,\"you returned early.\"</p><p>\"Yes my son.\", said Apeirog ,\"I am leaving again for the Council, there are some matters that needs to be addressed.\"</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">He moved towards Damion and put a hand on his shoulder and said ,\"I want you to find it for me. We don't have time\".&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Damion nodded to the disappearing figure of Apeirog.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">He stood alone in the hall for sometime and heaved a deep sigh. Then he walked out of the hall and came out into a large,dimly lit sitting room. The house was carved out of the same black stone in contrast to the white snow that wailed outside. The sitting room was furnished with a pair of sofa around a black stone table. Several other antique articles decorated the rest of the room.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">He went up to a large portrait that hung at the wall opposite to the hall entrance.</span></p><p>The portrait was of a young lady clad in a black cloak. Her knee long hairs fell over her body and her snow white face peeped out of the black surroundings. A faint smiled played at her lips. A pair of beautiful blue eyes looked at him. \"Mother\", wisphered Damion.</p><p>A tall figure moved towards him out of darkness. \"Master, will you have something?\", said the man with a quivering voice that perfectly matched with his wrinkled face and trembling hands. His hands folded in front of him were like white snowballs covered with black satin.&nbsp;</p><p>\"No, Tressilian. Just pack my things\", said Damion.</p><p>\"Master's going out.\" said Tressilian.</p><p>\"Yes\", replied Damion and then murmured to himself ,\"for a long time.\"</p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

As they neared the land, they could make out the huge trees that covered every inch that was available.&nbsp;</p><p>Among the trees there was a large clearing and a timber house was visible in the middle. Leilani slowly lowered the craft which landed in front of the house. The door opened and fresh air gushed in. </p><p>Shiv took a deep breath. It felt like she had never breathed properly. The air was so pure and cool.</p><p>They all came out. Professor remained in ,\"I'm going back to Shambala. I'll have to fix some story about your absence and Hans' death,\" he said with a pained expression ,\"I'll be back before father returns\". Then he flew away.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Come\", said Leilani. They followed her to the two storied timber house.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">The house was flooded with light. It was very airy and spacious. A wooden staircase on the right of the sitting room lead to the upper floor which was lined with rooms. On the left of the sitting room was another room. There were several windows around the room that spanned the whole length of the wall.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Not fair! Not even a single human-alien hybrid hanging from the ceiling.\" joked Agastya. Aradhya rolled her eyes and murmured something under her breath.</span></p><p>\"Boys, that room over the left is papa's, go and freshen up. There are some clothes too in the wardrobe.\" said Leilani indicating a room on the first floor with her finger ,\"Ladies follow me!\"</p><p>Shiv followed her to a room at the head of the staircase. As they entered, Aradhya went and fell on the bed closing her eyes. Shiv went towards the windows and looked out. At a distance there was a small village, just a handful of houses were visible. Suddenly a bright yellow bird entered in the room through the window. It fearlessly landed over Leilani's head and started chirping. She shook it off and went to her wardrobe. She opened it and said ,\"Due to my frequent visits to Earth I have made a good pile of Earthy clothes, you can wear any that you like. I am going to make something to eat. You must be hungry.\" Shiv's stomach growled in response.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Leilani went out smiling.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Shiv stepped down the stairs, a nice aroma of spices filled the air. \"What time is it?\", she wondered. \"Come in here!\", said Leilani peeping out of the room downstairs.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"You have sharp ears. What are you cooking?\", said Shiv entering the kitchen. \"How about some masala pasta?\", Leil answered.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"What do you eat?\",asked Shiv. \"We are aliens for you but that doesn't mean we eat humans!,\"Leil joked ,\"Here at Norma we also grow crops and have farms. Though that is not what you expected\".</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"No.\", smiled Shiv.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"As humans have grown out of natural evolution, so we have and that bound to have some similarities. You would have noticed the similarity between Norma and Earth. Our evolution was in much similar ways and that naturally makes us quite alike. All these years papa was with you, did you find anything strange about him?\"</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"You're right!\", Shiv agreed. At that moment James entered the kitchen.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Perfect fit\",exclaimed Leil. \"Yeah!\",he answered.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"When your grandpa will arrive?\", he asked.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Shouldn't take much time...maybe in half an hour, I suppose......come on, meal's ready\", said Leil.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">They helped her carry the plates to the table in the sitting room, which was surrounded with sofas. Aradhya trudged in and sat heavily on the sofa. \"I'm totally exhausted. Last night we didn't sleep and then all that happened. Ooof\",she complained.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"What time is it?\", asked Shiv.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Eighteen in the noon\", replied Leil ,\"Oh! You mean on Earth....It would be around twelve......Norma has forty eight hours for a day.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Forty eight hours!\", exclaimed Agastya who just joined the party. Professor's clothes dangling on his lean figure. Leil smiled widely on him (It gave him a wide shock and he stumbled a few steps).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"May I help you walk?,\" whispered James in his ears. Agastya gave him a scowl and went to sit beside Shiv. \"Don't get angry.\" she said to him.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Everyone arranged themselves and ate. The conversation didn't began until after cups of strong tulsi tea was handed to everyone.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"What's this council? Is it powerful enough to tame this Apeirog?\", asked Shiv.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Leil sipped for a moment and then commenced,\"Council is the most powerful system in the cosmos. It's like a government to each and every being in the universe, whether they know it exists or not.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"It all started about a million years ago when only nine civilisations existed in the cosmos, Corvi, Norma, Indus, Heka, Procyon, Karka, Olbera, Carpathia and Zagut. They all believed themselves to be the most powerful and advanced, the basis for the stuggle of supremacy that started the most devastating war of all time. All hell broke loose. It was a war that engulfed civilisations. Infant civilisations were the biggest victim, they were not even able to protect themselves.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Then after about thosand years of fierce devastation, Indus came forward for peace. An assembly was called, in which these nine civilisations put an end to the war. They agreed to establish a Council that would be supreme to everyone and they all would abide by it's laws.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Hence the Council dawned. Every civilisation chose it's representative for being a member of the Council. My grandpa succedes a long line of my ancestors who have been Council's member from ages.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"The council is divided into three parts. The highest are the members who make laws for the inhabitants of the cosmos. Then comes the workers who take account of everything that the Council does, from identifying the civilisations to keeping track of criminals...they do it all. Then there are the fighters. Who are like the police on the earth. They protect the innocent and punish the criminals. You know I am a fighter myself\", she finished gladly.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"You said your ancestors have been Norma's representative from a long time, then won't you be the same.\" asked Shiv.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"There's no boundation of heirarchy. I am free to choose and papa is there for that.\" said Leil ,\"And after that the people of Norma will choose the successor\".</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"So this law of secrecy is a mandatory of the Council.\" said James.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"Yes, the strictest. The Council believes that every civilisation should get a chance to grow naturally. Before the war, there had been instances where advanced civilisations made slaves of the infant civilisations and exploited them, some mad creatures even used them for experiments. When Council came into existance, it was decided that untill the baby civilisations became advanced enough to become a part of the Council or to protect themselves from invasions, they should be left undisturbed.\" Leil said.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"But there are some like Apeirog who evade even the Council.\" said Agastya.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"He thinks that he is kept out of his rights. It so happened that his father, who was a member of the council, became traitor. He cheated on the Council and was later executed. After that Corvi was declined of the right to represent in the Council. That's why Apeirog had to content by being an advisor. But he always tries to persuade the members, he has a very air tight image there, only a few know the truth.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\"But the main reason for his power is that he has an army of rogues. He frees those criminals whom we capture by producing fake evidences and then recruits them in his force. Me and my team, we have been trying for so long to gather a clue against him but he is shrewd.\" Leil made an exasperated face ,\"But now I think we finally have him\".</span></p><p>At that moment a knock came at the door and an elderly man entered. He had long white hairs and a long beard that came up to his belly. His wrinked face radiated of contempt and satisfaction. His brown wrinkled body was draped in an ochre coloured unstitched cloth. A figure of saint.</p><p>As he stepped inside, his smile faded and his eyes widened a little then in a moment he came back to his calm composure. Leilani exclaimed something in a different language and went up to him. She said ,\"This is my grandpa\".&nbsp;</p><p>Leilani plunged into a conversation with his grandfather in their language, who was listening to her intently. From time to time his forhead creased and he stopped her to ask something.&nbsp;</p><p>Shiv looked up at the old man when she heard him say \"Zahvier\", but as she was unable to understand further she left the attempt to listen. She stood up and strolled out of the house.&nbsp;</p><p>The house was surrounded by huge trees. They were larger and sturdier than their Earth counterpart. Shiv take a deep breath and thought ,\"We think we are the best untill we encounter something better.\"&nbsp;</p><p>She went into the forest. The whole surface of the land was covered in green and sunlight glimmered through the canopy. She sat down near a tree, at the spongy soft grass and rested her head at the tree trunk. Strange chirping noises filled the atmosphere. A soft breeze rustled the leaves and she closed her eyes. She had been dozing for sometime when she woke up suddenly at some noise.&nbsp;</p><p>As she opened her eyes she stopped dead. Her heart raced and breath got shallower. Her eyes focused at the creature in front of her. A large black catlike creature stood in front of her. It purred and it's white sharp teeth gleamed. Shiv gulped. Her instincts screamed of danger but she felt like her legs were made of wood. The creature groaned and stealthily stepped forward. Slowly it came so near that she could feel it's breath. The creature's gaze was fixed at her eyes. But then it stopped, it sniffed a few times and then backed away and vanished into the bushes.</p><p>Shiv exhaled and wiped her head. She stood up and walked groggily out of the forest.&nbsp;</p><p>James walked up to her and said ,\"Where have you been?\". \"Nothing, just strolling in the forest.\" she replied. \"What happened?\", he asked. \"Just saw some alien animals\", she said waving the topic away. Though she could still see the creature's dark black eyes gazing at her.</p><p>They entered the house. Agastya and Aradhya was nowhere to be seen. The old man was also not there. James answered her unspoken question ,\"Leil's grandpa went away soon after you left. Leil said he needed to fix some issues. She sent Agastya and Aradhya to sleep.\"</p><p>\"You should also go and take some rest\", Shiv said. James nodded and went away. \"Leil!\", she called. Leil answered from the kitchen. She went inside.</p><p>Leil had been busy cleaning. \"What he said?\" she asked. </p><p>\"Grandpa said that it won't be easy to frame Apeirog. And he also thinks that you all have to stay here for sometime. We can't provide you protection out of Norma untill the Council orders so. But don't worry we'll find some way.\"</p><p>\"Hmm,\" said Shiv and yawned.&nbsp;</p><p>\"You should take some sleep\", said Leil.</p><p>Shiv entered Leil's room. Aradhya was already deep in sleep. She went to the bed and lied beside her.&nbsp;</p><p>She closed her eyes and saw a pair of black eyes staring at her.</p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

It was an old building dating to pre independence times and was refurbished into a luxurious hotel. It was the biggest construction in that small town, just a small distance away from the train station.</p><p>Chaitra came out of the car, she stood holding the door with one hand, her face lit of the light that came out of the hotel. Daaruk came up to her ,\"Nice buiding, Victorian gothic architecture\" he remarked.</p><p>\"Hmm, at the height of 2,500m above sea level\", she replied and breathed out mist from her mouth ,\"We're all set for some mystery\".</p><p>Chaitra's gaze moved over the building as Daaruk got busy instructing the valet about handling luggage. Mrs. Daksha has already moved in.&nbsp;</p><p>Chaitra was staring at the windows when she saw Ahan. He was standing at the other side of the car, facing street, and was gesturing with his fingers, as if summoning someone. Instinctively she looked around but found no one.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">She hastily reset herself as Ahan was about to turn. She didn't wanted to be noticed spying on someone.</span></p><p>They all went inside.</p><p>There was a small garden inside the hotel surrounded by corridors on all sides. People were coming out of their rooms to enjoy the open air. Fireflies were swerving around the garden flowers producing an effaicaciously beautiful and ornamental view of the surrounding. Fresh hill breeze scented the atmosphere.&nbsp;</p><p>Reception was set up in that garden. A fair and fox like lady was sitting there. She raised her eyes to look at the approaching lot and nuged her spectacles with her finger. \"Welcome to Savoy Hotel. Are you here for long stay? We have about 150 rooms here, all grand, peaceful, heritageous and we have varieties in them based on the history associated with them. No two rooms alike. What would you like?\", she finished in one breath in a squeaking voice.</p><p>Both Chaitra and Daaruk plumed for mountain view rooms.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Mrs. Mani accompanied Chaitra to her room. Ahan escorted Daaruk to his place after the formalities were taken care of.</span></p><p>Chaitra's mouth hang open at the sight of that large, lavish room. She went up to the heavily curtained windows and looked out at the mountains. She flung open the windows and cool breeze filed in, she shivered. Mrs. Mani questioned the valet regarding the details of the stay. After that she turned to withdraw when Chaitra bombarded her with questions.</p><p>\"Ma'am do you know anything about this recent dug up?\"</p><p>\"How long Ahan had been appointed here?\"</p><p>\"What do you think of him? It's strange that so much security is being provided for this bussiness.\"</p><p>Mrs. Mani smiled and said in a calm voice ,\"My dear! Breathe a moment. I know you must be curious. Even in my twenty years career, never I saw government so much intrested in our work. By the way mysteries are an inseparable part of this place and this hotel.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\", asked Chaitra.</p><p>\"Villagefolk here believe in a lot of things. One wouldn't believe them but what you'll do of tourists. Not that I've seen anything in my twenty years here\", she said half-heartedly.</p><p>\"I don't understand\", said Chaitra, her forehead creased.</p><p>\"Apparitions,\" said Mrs. Mani ,\"Ghosts I mean\". Chaitra shook her head. Mrs. Mani clarified ,\"I don't say I believe in them but this is what people say. There's a story that years ago there was a lady named Garnel Orme, who was a well known British spiritualist, was murdered in this hotel. Investigations were conducted but they remained empty handed. Except that lady's body they found no clues, no evidences, nothing. And then a few years later her doctor was murdered too in the same suspicious circumstances. I don't know but since I'm here I feel like it's walls hold some serious secrets.</p><p>\"But as I told you I've never had any experience myself so who knows what's the truth. By the way, this place is nice and well kept considering it to be an old building\". she finished.</p><p>\"Murder\", murmured Chaitra then proceeded loudly ,\"This place is really wierd. I mean it's not been even five minutes here and I get to know that two people got murdered here.\" she turned to look outside the windows and then said ,\"Whatever it may be but one thing is certain, there is definitely something hidden beneath this soil that had attracted so many noses\".</p><p>\"Yes dear so it seems. By the way, Ahan came here early this morning and after meeting me he directly went to the dig up site.\"</p><p>Meanwhile in a corridor Ahan and Daaruk were in midst of a heated debate...</p><p>\"You know how we work, we archeologists adopt the best and finest of methods to find out even an atom of a clue that is coupled with our reasearch\", said Daaruk watching Ahan's face intently.</p><p>Ahan remarked rather sourly ,\"That's what all professionals do\".</p><p>\"Oh right!\", said Daaruk surrendered ,\"What do you know about this matter though?\", he asked changing the topic.</p><p>\"What's the hurry man, we'll start it tomorrow. Ask the reception if you want anything and Good Night!\", Ahan said and went away.</p><p>\"Good night Mr. Perfect</p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",
