            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8">South Indians have a culture to get up before sunrise, so did Chaitra had due to her hereditary norms. The first thing she did was to open the curtains and bow to the horizon that had started to redden. In her culture sun symbolises a divine guide that lightens the path in darkest of times.
<div><br></div><div>She hastily freshened up, eager to start the investigation of her new project, and was standing with a cup of black tea when Daaruk bustled in her room.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Good morning", she said and then sensing some underlying frustation in his face she asked ,"What's it? Why are you upset?"
</div><div><br></div><div>Daaruk shook his head ,"It's nothing. Let's go for the breakfast."
</div><div><br></div><div>On the ground floor, opposite to the reception table, stood open the door to a large dining hall. Daaruk and Chaitra entered. The hall was almost empty but for some early risers who were about to start their meal. The long dining table that was the centre piece of the hall was adorned with gateau, club sandwiches, canapes, some deserts along with tea and coffee for the guests. The ceiling was adorned with a beautiful chandelier and the blue tinted walls were empty except for few lamps decorated on it. The room was full of the scent of fresh wild flowers that were present in huge vases.
</div><div><br></div><div>They took their seats and the butler served them.  
</div><div><br></div><div>"It feels like an English breakfast", Daaruk observed ,"I see they still follow pre independence menu, rather lavish".
</div><div><br></div><div>Chaitra nodded approvingly.
</div><div><br></div><div>The nice hearty breakfast seemed to cheer Daaruk up so Chaitra decided to converse,"So Daaruk, I was coming to you to ask if we should check for that incidental spot where things have went awkwardly, do you have any descriptional data about the entire happening. Did Ahaan inform you of anything?"
</div><div><br></div><div>"No," he said dryly ,"Didn't Mrs. Daksha tell you anything?"
</div><div><br></div><div>"No, but I assume that even she is not informed completely". She thought it wise not to mention the story that Mrs. Daksha told her. She knew well that Daaruk was quite skeptical when it came to paranormal and anyway she didn't believe in any foolish pastime of village folk.
</div><div><br></div><div>"By the way, Ahaan came to my room this morning. He said that some people had come over who were involved in the shoving process. They may tell us something.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Lets meet them. Only then we can formulate any theories. But Chaitra don't you think that this Ahaan has a crooked head. Even more than that...." Daaruk said making a face.
</div><div><br></div><div>Chaitra cut in ,"Why do you think so?"
</div><div><br></div><div>Daaruk didn't answered. He just raised an eyebrow and shook his head. Chaitra almost heard him say,"You'll see for yourself".
</div><div><br></div><div>And she never easily dismissed his opinions about people. He had a 'sixth sense' about it. But she was surprised that he had formed his opinion about Ahaan so early, what was it that prompted him to think of Ahaan having a 'crooked head'. Whatever it was, it surely can't be that he had seen him summoning someone on an apparently empty road.
</div><div><br></div><div>Her thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door. She looked up, Ahaan was standing there. They had finished their coffee by that time so they immediately went up to him.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Good morning", said Ahaan warmly. They returned the greeting equally warmly.
</div><div><br></div><div>"The men from the site have reached. They're waiting in the garden to be of some help", said Ahaan to Daaruk and asked Chaitra to come along.
</div><div><br></div><div>While walking through the corridor Daaruk asked,"Last night why you denied to part away with any information?"
</div><div><br></div><div>Ahaan answered somewhat resentfully ,"What denied?You were tired last night and don't you know that we all arrived here on the same day and what I know, you're going to know all more accurately and elaborately from the eyewitnesses of the incidence." 
</div><div><br></div><div>After this Ahaan strided forward but Daaruk caught him again ,"Don't you think you're more insolent than required, do you talk like that even with your family".
</div><div><br></div><div>Ahaan slowed his speed and stopped listening to Daaruk further. He took a deep sigh and uttered under his breath ,"Hmm, family!". There was a lost expression in his eyes.
</div><div><br></div><div>Untill this time, Chaitra had patiently listened to their battering but now she thought it wise to interrupt ,"Where are those men, we are in the garden."
</div><div><br></div><div>"They are in the opposite corner, follow me." Ahaan said.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Chaitra, what he thinks he is". Daaruk uttered frustated.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Later, look we've reached", she said dismissively.
</div><div><br></div><div>Ending the expostulations, they all went to the members of the association who were part of the shoving process. There were three people sitting around a table in a far corner of the garden. Nicely dressed, they looked like the local residents of the place. One of them looked rather more fine. Chaitra guessed him to be the supervisor.
</div><div><br></div><div>Chaitra and Daaruk seated themselves around the table while Ahaan preferred to stand straight palpably facing Chaitra and the two members of the working staff. Tea was served.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Well, meet Jagrav, the supervisor of the dig up team, a reputed architect and almost a specialist in hotel mapping", Ahaan introduced amiably.
</div><div><br></div><div>Daaruk greeted Jagrav and asked the other two men ,"Are you two also architects?"
</div><div><br></div><div>Ahaan dweebly replied ,"Trinabh and Jaivant are co-heads of the team under consideration".
</div><div><br></div><div>Chaitra was about to say something when she heard scuffling footsteps coming from the corridor towards them.</div></div>
