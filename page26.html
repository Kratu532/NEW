        <div class="media-container-row">
            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8">On Earth, the direction from where the sun rises is considered east, Shiv thought, and where it sets is called west. Other directions are conventioned accordingly. So following this line of thought the direction from where sun on the Norma rises, if we are free to call Norma's host star as 'sun', should be the purported east here and so where she was can be safely said to be a place at the eastern fringe of the forest that surrounded Professor's residence.
<div><br></div><div>The idea was of Leilani that they should tour their farms and orchids, as Professor was also heading there for some farm-chores so they followed.
</div><div><br></div><div>At first glance one would think that they had a very large estate and it was only well assumed granted that Leil's grandpa was Council's member, this is a general identification of aristocrats and elites, according to Earth's concepts. But it seemed to Shiv that after all Norma was not Earth. Leil told her that their farms and orchids are no bigger than that of any other peasant at Norma and as the population here is not very formidable so everyone had a large area to take care of.
</div><div><br></div><div>"It's very funny, I thought you called yourself hunters", said Shiv to Leil as they walked alongside a huge field of shrubs with little blue berries. 
</div><div><br></div><div>"We eventually learned that Norma has limited supply of animals",smiled Leil. 
</div><div><br></div><div>There were wide fields of crops that somewhat looked like paddy and wheat, but with visible differences. On the south was another dense forest but with the domination of fruit bearing trees. "Those are our orchids", Leil pointed out.
</div><div><br></div><div>"But that doesn't look like one", said Shiv.
</div><div><br></div><div>"I know", said Leil ,"but trees specifically lined as soldiers on a marching field is not an orchid, you..well...you can't tame nature. Can you?"
</div><div><br></div><div>Further on their path, a Norman lady was standing, hands folded and clad in the same ochre unstiched cloth as Leil's grandpa. Leil hastened to her and started conversing in their language. The lady nodded several times, and seemed to be giving clarification about something, sometimes she would glance in Shiv's direction and if their eyes met, she smiled gracefully. Few minutes later Leil told Shiv to explore the place on her own as she had to accompany that lady to the fields. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Shiv was only too willing to do that. She strolled towards the grazing area in the north of the fields. There a herd of huge yak-like animals were grazing, the difference was that they had lesser hairs and no horns. The calves were galloping among the elders, enjoying their play, especially to the annoyance of others who grunted as they bumped into them.
</div><div><br></div><div>Agastya and James were trying to mount a sturdy yak-like Norman animal. Shiv wondered why the boys always had to ride on, they can simply roam also. At this thought she looked out for Aradhya and found her inside a field inspecting the crop. Further as she shifted her gaze, she found Professor sitting near a tree close to the forest with a calf in his lap and a medicine box at his side. He had a pencil thick metal pipe in his hand, the tip of which was illuminated, and he was looking inside the long ear of the animal.
</div><div><br></div><div>She went up and sat beside him. 
</div><div><br></div><div>"What's this animal called Professor?" she asked.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Styx", he mumbled.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Ironic, they are quite sturdy", she said. Professor nodded and rolled the baby styx over to inspect it's other ear. Shiv looked up at others and smiled. No one had ever imagined such a peaceful encounter with aliens, she thought. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Now Leil was instructing a small group of Normans, all dressed alike except her who looked more like human in her shirt and trouser. Shiv had noted that Leil found this kind of dressing more comfortable as she had never seen her dressed otherwise.
</div><div><br></div><div>"She has been a lonely girl, isn't it?", she said to Professor.
</div><div><br></div><div>Professor had finished his examination of the styx calf and was stroking it's back when he answered ,"Hmm, her mother died when she was very young. My mother also died before my marriage and father always stays away. I stayed with her for sometime in her early childhood but then I got myself busy. She very nearly brought herself up."
</div><div><br></div><div>"How was she? Your wife I mean." she said thinking why she never talked to him about this topic before. All the time they were at Earth, they never talked the most obvious, just about difficult physics. 
</div><div><br></div><div>"There aren't any pictures in the house......or Normans don't have them", she asked.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Leil prefers not to have them, maybe it reminds her of the loss in her life", he answered looking in the wide brown eyes of the calf ,"I met her during a mission. I was on a desolate planet, very badly injured. I tried to communicate with my team but with no success. I was about to lose hope when a spacecraft landed. 
</div><div><br></div><div>"I was lying on the land and she came over me. I saw her just for a second before passing out, but that was enough to tell me that I found my missing part of soul".
</div><div><br></div><div>Shiv felt guilty, she had never heard the note of pain so clear in his voice before. She had never seen Professor trying to hide his eyes by looking away.
</div><div><br></div><div>"On the day when it all started Professor, when the Corvians arrested you," she started hoping to change the subject ,"you said something regarding some 'truth'. I never got it."
</div><div><br></div><div>Professor answered readily ,"That was a signal to my accomplises, they were near the observatory. I wanted to warn them."
</div><div><br></div><div>"They were the 'outside help' you were talking about".
</div><div><br></div><div>"Yes. When I was captivated, they went to the observatory to take away all the things before Corvians could lay their hands onto it."
</div><div><br></div><div>"Those officials....yes. The police officer thought them to be from CBI, but he also said that the officials thought that you betrayed someone".
</div><div><br></div><div>"That was to satiate the local gossip, my sudden arrest needed some cover. If not from Apeirog then from us."
</div><div><br></div><div>"You told that the government don't know anything about it. But we got emails from ISRO and when Hans called the authorites he got answers, though vague."
</div><div><br></div><div>"Those were my comrades at work."
</div><div><br></div><div>"So where are they now".
</div><div><br></div><div>"They got killed when trying to save me. Before coming out from their clutches, I did a lot of damage, though in turn they destroyed our bases. That's why I had to call Leil to help", untill now Professor was almost out of his pain and was talking animatedly ,"I'm sure Apeirog was very irritated about it, that's why he dangered coming in contact with you to capture me".
</div><div><br></div><div>"All this just for a pen...I wonder what information does it have", Shiv tried her luck, but Professor merely nodded. He was looking ahead, the calf in his lap didn't try to free itself from his hold. She noted that it was quite skinny, maybe diseased. 
</div><div><br></div><div>She followed Professor's gaze and saw Leilani standing near a lean brown man in ochre clothing. "That's Tamio, he helps Leil on the farms", told Professor ,"She has to go out a lot, she's a fighter, the cosmic police, and for that interval Tamio takes care of all this".
</div><div><br></div><div>Ultimately James and Agastya had conquered the sturdy styx. They were presumably trying to race but it can't be said for sure as their path mainly consisted of arcs and circles. The styx were particularly tame, not the little ones, and they easily gave to the wishes of others. This Shiv thought because Agastya was never able to claim the vicinity of even a cow on Earth.
</div><div><br></div><div>Aradhya was now roaming in the orchids with the lady whom Shiv had seen before. They weren't talking but the lady was trying to convey her meaning by gesticulations. She took her towards a fruit tree and plucked a pinkish fruit, about the size of a cricket ball, from it and offered it to her. The lady gestured to eat it and made a face as if she was savouring some rich delicacy. Aradhya gingerly took it from her and wondered whether to eat it or not. She politely thanked her and made her way out of the orchid.
</div><div><br></div><div>She came to Shiv and sat down. 
</div><div><br></div><div>"It's ripe....though it's an early time for that", said Professor ,"maybe a few would have done so". 
</div><div><br></div><div>"Can we eat it?" asked Aradhya.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Sure." he answered ,"but only if you share".
</div><div><br></div><div>Aradhya turned it over thinking whether to peel it or not. If you had an orange or a banana you would not give as much a second thought as to what to do next. You'll peel it and savour the fruit. If you had an apple then you'll eat it straight away. The point is that, as a resident on Earth and with the help of past experiences we know about these petty things and take this knowledge for granted. But if you had a Norman fruit in your hand, what will you do?
</div><div><br></div><div>Professor understood the dilemma and took the fruit from her hand. He then pulled the twig out, that protruded from it's top and like a flower the fruit opened as if cut into several pieces. The girls looked at it in awe. Inside, the fruit was a juicy red. He offered them the fruit slices.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">It tasted like sugarcane but with a tinge of sourness in it.</span></div><div><br></div><div>"I like it", said Shiv.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Everybody does", smiled Professor.
</div><div><br></div><div>Shiv took a few pieces to the boys. They had rode on a little distance but as saw her approaching them, turned backwards.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Who won", she asked. 
</div><div><br></div><div>"Me", said Agastya instantly.
</div><div><br></div><div>"What's this?", asked James as he jumped down. He took a bite and instantly his face showed pleasure. His face is so easy to read, thought Shiv, like a picture.
</div><div><br></div><div>"It's all right", said Agastya nodding in approval.
</div><div><br></div><div>Leilani had freed until then and had joined Professor on the grass, Agastya instantly forgot about the styx and went there. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Shiv shook her head,"This boy's gone crazy".
</div><div><br></div><div>"Do you want this?" James showed her the last piece.
</div><div><br></div><div>"No, you have it." she said.
</div><div><br></div><div>"James, do you remember that box you found in Professor's room while clearing it", she said as the thing suddenly came to her.
</div><div><br></div><div>He thought for sometime and then replied,"Yeah, I remember".
</div><div><br></div><div>"I saw it in Professor's room yesterday".
</div><div><br></div><div>"He bought it here....but why?"
</div><div><br></div><div>As they slowly walked back to the group, Shiv told him about the answers Professor had given of the happenings that had resulted in their interstellar travel. 
</div><div><br></div><div>"Quite extraordinary it is", he said.</div></div>
