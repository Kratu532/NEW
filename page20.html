    <div class="container">
        <div class="media-container-row">
            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8">Shiv was standing in the morning glow of sun. Her arm had a deep laser burn but she can't feel the pain, she even can't breathe, her legs locked in position. Her body erect, she stood gaping, her mind ringing of the question, "Am I dreaming?"
<div><br></div><div>In the small clearing in front of the cave mountain, a small spacecraft was landed. By no standards it was a normal aircraft she had ever seen. It was long, its wings folded with a glass frame for the cockpit from where Leilani was beaming at her. She was amused at her expression or ignorance wasn't clear. She gestured to come in fast.
</div><div><br></div><div>James, who was in better senses, felt that Shiv's wound needs treatment. He took her right arm and half dragged her inside by the side door. As they entered, the door jammed itself. Shiv blinked her eyes, as if that would bring any sense to what was happening.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Everyone sit down, I'm taking off!", ordered Leilani.
</div><div><br></div><div>Fire jets purred and the spacecraft came to life. It slowly lifted off the ground and unfurled it's wings. In a whoosh they were off. With a blinding speed they raced to sky as it changed from blue to black. The stars raced back so fast that they seemed to stretch in line.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">A few seconds later Leilani put the craft in autopilot and turned around in her chair. Her expression tense.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Professor handed a first aid to Aradhya and went to sit at the co pilot chair. He looked out of the window.
</div><div><br></div><div>Aradhya attended to Shiv's wound who punctuated the silence with "AAh"s and "OOh"s.
</div><div><br></div><div>Agastya was impatiently drumming his fingers on his knee. He opened his mouth now and then but closed without saying anything.
</div><div><br></div><div>James' eyes were fixed at Professor's back. "You are Zahvier, isn't it Professor?", he broke the silence. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Professor turned his chair. He looked at Leilani, who nodded at his unspoken question, and then looked into Shiv's eyes.
</div><div><br></div><div>"I'm sorry I put you all in danger. You shouldn't be here......you don't even know how many rules I am breaking at the moment", said Professor in a broken voice.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Then break one more and tell us what's happening", said Agastya in an exasperated tone, utterly frustated with the suspense.
</div><div><br></div><div>Professor took a deep sigh and began ,"Yes, I am Zahvier!" he paused a moment and then continued ,"Those damned Corvians!..... Cecile is a shrewd man, even among the Corvians, he is the best impersonator."
</div><div><br></div><div>"What's Corvians?", asked Agastya raising an eyebrow.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Oh, Corvians are those who live at Corvi, the planet in...",  "Corvus constillation, right?", interjected Aradhya. 
</div><div><br></div><div>"You mean ALIENS!", shouted Agastya.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Yes!", said Professor smiling a bit ,"Corvians have power to impersonate anyone. I should have been more careful. I never imagined that you all will get involved in this bussiness. I presume Hans have told you about our meeting."
</div><div><br></div><div>"Yes, after the call....but why you called us Professor when Hans was already finding that pen for you?", asked Shiv.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Because Cecile found me out at the cottage. I had to make a hasty run and I wanted that pen at any cost. I thought it better to inform you about it so that later I can have it. But things went wrong....badly wrong.
</div><div><br></div><div>"After getting away from Cecile, I called Leil to help. At night when I went to our meeting place, Hans wasn't there, so I went to the observatory. Mrs. Mufti informed me that you all went out with Hans somewhere. This meant danger.
</div><div><br></div><div>"We tracked your scent.."  
</div><div><br></div><div>"What? How? With dogs", interupted Agastya.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Normans don't need dogs to track scent", Leilani smiled (Agastya went red in face) ,"We Normans are very good hunters", her eyes twinkled.
</div><div><br></div><div>"And your scent took me to that mountain", restarted Professor ,"Apeirog never leaves traces of his contact with humans. It's against the Council to make direct contact with the species that is not exposed to intergalactic community. Humans are unaware of our existance, they don't know that nine intelligent civilizations inhabit the cosmos along with numerous child civilizations like themselves. 
</div><div><br></div><div>"Apeirog is a higher member of the Council and if it is disclosed that he made direct contacts with humans then that could be disastrous to him. He always kills them who meets him and you were also destined to that fate. 
</div><div><br></div><div>"By the way, you aren't safe at the moment. He would send his men for you soon. That's why I'm taking you to Norma, there you'll be guarded until Council takes Apeirog down."
</div><div><br></div><div>"And how our absence will be explained at Shambala?", asked James.
</div><div><br></div><div>"I don't know! At the moment your safety is more important. This is the least I can do after what I have done to your lives. I'm sorry.", said Professor with a sad face.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Don't be Professor. It was us who decided to meet you there", said Aradhya in a consoling tone.
</div><div><br></div><div>"It was fate, Aradhya.... Professor does the government knows about it. I mean when you were arrested....", said Shiv.
</div><div><br></div><div>"No, they were Corvians. They wanted that pen.", answered Professor.
</div><div><br></div><div>"What that pen contains that it is so important for everyone?", asked James.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Aah, just some information of the Council. My father, a member of the Council, gave me that to keep safe. It is important and Apeirog wants it.", summarised Professor rather hastily.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">He looked at Leilani and gave her a little nod. She stared at him for some time and then said ,"We will reach Norma in an hour. You all can go and rest in the upper compartment."</span></div><div><br></div><div>They climbed up the metal rod stairs which led to upper room. It was a bit more spacious than downstairs. It had a bed by the right wall and a rugged couch on the left wall. There was a small cupboard in the back wall. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Shiv lied down on the bed and closed her eyes. She needed time to intake what they had come to know.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">James sat on the couch where Agastya was lying. Aradhya sat at the bed beside Shiv.</span></div><div><br></div><div>"We're going to visit a planet that's out of our solar system! It's an astrophysicist's dream come true!", said Shiv smiling at the others.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Yeah! And that's other thing that we are pursued by an intergalactic murderer. First humans for that too!", said James smiling back.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Don't spoil the fun Jamiee, we're among aliens, even Professor is an alien, now imagine that!", exclaimed Agastya.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Do you think we'll have to keep all this secret as per that so called 'Council's' rules? In that case we'll have to come up with a really good story." said Aradhya.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Hmm. By the way, did anyone saw Agastya when Leil smiled at him. He was a tomato." giggled Shiv.
</div><div><br></div><div>"No I wasn't. You're lying", said Agastya blushing again.
</div><div><br></div><div>"Is she? I also saw that", said James poking him with a fist.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Aradhya laughed.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Meanwhile downstairs....
</div><div><br></div><div>"Papa, do you think Council can ever get Apeirog, he had been evading them for so long. What with all that contact with the Council members and his little force, I don't think we can ever leave them ungaurded." said Leilani.
</div><div><br></div><div>Professor scowled. "You're right Leil, that's why I'm taking them to Norma. Father will show us the way."
</div><div><br></div><div>"You didn't even tell them the truth about that pen."
</div><div><br></div><div>"They needn't know about that. We have to ensure a way out of this for them not to permanently involve them in this war."
</div><div><br></div><div>"I don't think we can do anything to avoid thier involvement. All these years we have been hiding from humans and suddenly out of nowhere these people land in our spaceship heading towards Norma. Even now can anyone refute that they aren't destined for this fate." 
</div><div><br></div><div>Professor didn't say anything. He took a deep sigh and shook his head.
</div><div><br></div><div>"We've reached! Everyone come down." shouted Leilani.</div></div>
