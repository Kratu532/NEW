            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>I&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">The automatic doors of the spacecraft slid open and steel cold air whipped at my face. I was only too accustomed to these extreme atmospheres owing to my work that took me to the far corners of the cosmos. I stepped out on the hard snow and looked up at the black mansion that rose arrogantly in front of me.</span></p><p>I reached to the landing and knocked at the hard black wooden door. I always found it weird, to knock. It was opened by an ancient looking man, a heap of bones, he was. White as ash with dark blue hollow eyes. He bowed to me and said ,"Madame Marjorie, what a pleasure!"</p><p>"Perhaps it's not a pleasure Tressilian." I admited ,"Where's Apeirog?".</p><p>"Master's in the hall".</p><p>"Someone's here to meet him?"</p><p>"No he is all alone".</p><p>I had long left the hope of getting any information from Tressilian. Once I had been to Earth, there people like him are called 'loyal as a dog'. And Tressilian was loyal, more than any dog on Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>"And you also don't know the whereabouts of Damion?", I asked.</p><p>"Ah, I'm sorry Madame. I hope I could have been of much more use." he said. His head hanging on his chest.</p><p>I freed him from lying anymore ,"Take me to him."</p><p>He obeyed.</p><p>Apeirog was sitting on his throne when I entered. He slowly stood up and almost glided down the stairs towards me. The most dangerous thing about Corvians is that they are good at stealth. They would be standing behind you and you would never notice. Combine with this the power to impersonate and you have converted a person into a weapon.&nbsp;</p><p>Apeirog bowed down in front of me and said in his sweet voice ,"Why this effort Madame?"</p><p>I smiled and he smiled.</p><p>We both knew that it was just a formality. He knew that how much I try I would never be able to prove that someday ago he met that scroundrel Cecile or that murderer Morbius. He knew it too well and I knew too. I began my rehearsed speech that I had used on so many occasions.</p><p>"The Council received an anonymous information regarding you Apeirog"</p><p>"Again", he exclaimed looking annoyed ,"I hope this time the schemers have something strong against me". He said generously.</p><p>"I know you are clean", I lied ,"but the Council has to go through the procedures".</p><p>"Of couse, I understand, please proceed".</p><p>"Tressilian", he called out. Like an apparition he entered the hall.</p><p>"Tressilian, there are some people outside in the spaceship. Will you be kind enough to bring them in here?" I asked him.</p><p>He nodded and went away.</p><p>There were only two persons whom I had brought with me. They were deft and efficient. They started combing out data of the apparation device in the house. They questioned Tressilian and a few other workers and in a few minutes the drama ended.</p><p>They both went away and we were left alone.</p><p>"Not again, I thought maybe this time they were right", he said.</p><p>"You are being too hopeful. Not even a single accusation proved to be right", I said.</p><p>"Where's Damion?" I asked and enjoyed the little discomfort that flashed in his body.</p><p>"I don't know." he said sounding exasperated ,"The boy's rebellious, he wanders on his own. Never knew he will grow up to be like this".</p><p>I nodded pretending to be sympathetic.</p><p>"After the tragic death of his mother," he continued ,"he changed completely. You know how it was like, he was so young and the way she died, I think that was a big shock to him".</p><p>I sighed. The same old story again. I knew that this was the culmination of the conversation.</p><p>"I think I should leave now", I said.</p><p>II&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Marjorie was out of the black mansion Apeirog shook his head.&nbsp;</p><p>"Filthy!", he hissed ,"Only if I knew who it was."</p><p>Habitually his eyes wandered to the portrait of his father that hung at the wall beside a long line of family portraits. His face looked like a picture of pure disgust. He hastily turned around and walked up to the windows.</p><p>He was about to wander off in his thoughts when he turned around at a soft moan. His expressionless eyes stared at the cowering figure of Cecile.&nbsp;</p><p>Cecile was in a pity state. His right shoulder was wraped up in a tattered cloth which was blotted with green splotches and he was holding it with his left hand. He was heavily bruised and winced now and then whenever the searing pain shot through him. But his blue eyes shined as if of victory and his face was lit up with a broad smile.</p><p>"Master", he said and bowed.</p><p>Apeirog stood erect, he didn't move as much as a muscle and waited for Cecile to continue.</p><p>"I have to tell you something", he said slowly savouring every moment. His mind bubbling with the happiness of the information he withheld.&nbsp;</p><p>"Go on, I'm listening", hissed Apeirog.</p><p>"I was on Norma, I had trapped one of those earthlings and was about to kill her when", he stopped and looked at his mangled shoulder ," when out of nowhere it pounced onto me and dragged me about".</p><p>Apeirog's eyes shined and he glided closer to Cecile.&nbsp;</p><p>Cecile smiled ever more widely and said ,"Yes master, it was an Obsidian, the black cat!"</p><p>"The Obsidian saved that earthling", hissed Apeirog. His eyes staring blankly in the air.</p><p>"Yes master", he continued eagerly ,"it almost killed me but when it saw that girl, it just....... let me go........."</p><p>Apeirog had stopped listening anymore and had gone into a fit of hysterics. His steel laughter reverberated through the hall. The cold mirth made Cecile shudder. He tumbled a few steps back.</p><p>"Now Xahvier, my dear", he said to himself laughing ,"what will you do?...."</p><p>"Bring me all the information about that girl Cecile", he ordered him a few minutes later when he was able to control his laughter and Cecile went away.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"The time has come, I must act soon". he said and disappeared leaving a cold laugh echoing in the hall.</span></p></div>
