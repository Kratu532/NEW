It's roof has collapsed inside, the walls were laden with moss and fungi, with multitude of plants and shrubs growing at every possible crevice, mushrooms just hidden out of sight inside the damp floor beneath the grass.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">The mist glided in through the broken windows. Wrapping the place in steel coldness.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The hollow door noiselessly opened just enough that a wrinkled old man could slip inside. He limped slowly in the room and closed the door in a failed attempt to keep the cold outside. His tattered clothes barely covering his body. His ragged clothe bag, which he slumped over his arching back, seemed to be the only possession that he had.</p><p>He put the bag down on the broken floor and started roaming in the house.</p><p>"It must be somewhere here, I suppose", he hissed as the vapour came from between his teeth.</p><p>He fumbled through the grass, apparently clearing the place. When some mushrooms were thrown to the other side of the room and grass brutally uprooted, the soft soil was visible on the floor then he got up and reached for his bag. He took out a glass piece from it and hovered it over the soil. A beep sounded in the silence and the old man agitatedly began to dug the place.&nbsp;</p><p>His paper hand seemed to possess unnatural agility and strength. Even when he was holding the glass piece his hands were unusually still.&nbsp;</p><p>A minute later, the old loon stopped and exclaimed a delightful ,"Ha!"</p><p>There was a stone tablet buried in the soil, it's upper surface was carved into strange but sharp symbols. The old man touched some odd symbols, as if he was performing a ritual, and the surface began to change. The symbols moved and rearranged themselves into a straight line.&nbsp;</p><p>"Kailasa", he said in a strong voice. He put the glass piece over the surface and lifted it up. The surface of the tablet was still visible on it.</p><p>He hurried out of the ruined house along with his possesions and started limping as he reached the road. Some people were walking in through the fog, completely wrapped up in their clothes.</p><p>A woman crossed the old man, she stopped and looked pityingly at him and then nodded as if deciding something and walked away.</p><p>After sometime the old man vanished into the woods.</p></div>
